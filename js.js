        "a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage whose\n" +
        "beautiful life was chiseled for the ages. He was one of the great\n" +
        "masters who are Indias sole remaining wealth. Emerging in every\n" +
        "generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate of\n" +
        "Babylon and Egypt.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of\n" +
        "a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant\n" +
        "life, a yogi amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of\n" +
        "the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse\n" +
        "of the future.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind.\n" +
        "I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express\n" +
        "myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized\n" +
        "my bodily impotence. My strong emotional life took silent form as\n" +
        "words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues,\n" +
        "my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali\n" +
        "syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of an infants mind!\n" +
        "adultly considered limited to toys and toes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Psychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many\n" +
        "obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment\n" +
        "at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mothers\n" +
        "caresses, and my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling\n" +
        "step. These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a\n" +
        "natural basis of self-confidence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known\n" +
        "to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by\n" +
        "the dramatic transition to and from life and death. If man be\n" +
        "solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity.\n" +
        "But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is\n" +
        "essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human\n" +
        "egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During\n" +
        "travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections\n" +
        "from the lips of veracious men and women.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed\n" +
        "my first eight years at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the\n" +
        "United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four\n" +
        "boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh, was the second\n" +
        "son and the fourth child.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. Both\n" +
        "were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and\n" +
        "dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental\n" +
        "harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young\n" +
        "lives.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern.\n" +
        "Loving him dearly, we children yet observed a certain reverential\n" +
        "distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided\n" +
        "principally by his intellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts,\n" +
        "and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed\n" +
        "more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often\n" +
        "metamorphosed into my mothers.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In Mothers presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance\n" +
        "with the scriptures. Tales from the MAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA \n" +
        "were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline.\n" +
        "Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mothers dressing us\n" +
        "carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office.\n" +
        "His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the\n" +
        "Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of Indias large companies. His work\n" +
        "involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during\n" +
        "my childhood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly\n" +
        "disposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget.\n" +
        "One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Fathers\n" +
        "monthly income.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable\n" +
        "limit. Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother.\n" +
        "She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any\n" +
        "disagreement.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Good-by; I am going away to my mothers home. Ancient ultimatum!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived\n" +
        "opportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered\n" +
        "no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory\n" +
        "remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble\n" +
        "I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic\n" +
        "discussion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived\n" +
        "at the house. Mothers smile had its own persuasion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why ten rupees? One is enough. Father added a justification: When\n" +
        "my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of\n" +
        "poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was\n" +
        "a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that\n" +
        "I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month. He\n" +
        "declined, remarking that even a rupee is important.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee! Mothers heart\n" +
        "had an instant logic. Do you want this woman also to remember\n" +
        "painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You win! With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he\n" +
        "opened his wallet. Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with\n" +
        "my good will.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father tended to first say No to any new proposal. His attitude\n" +
        "toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mothers sympathy\n" +
        "was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant\n" +
        "acceptance--typical of the French mind in the West-is really only\n" +
        "honoring the principle of due reflection. I always found Father\n" +
        "reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster\n" +
        "up my numerous requests with one or two good arguments, he invariably\n" +
        "put the coveted goal within my reach, whether it were a vacation\n" +
        "trip or a new motorcycle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early\n" +
        "years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He\n" +
        "never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation\n" +
        "in various spiritual practices and in reading the BHAGAVAD GITA.\n" +
        " Shunning all luxuries, he would cling to one old pair of\n" +
        "shoes until they were useless. His sons bought automobiles after\n" +
        "they came into popular use, but Father was always content with the\n" +
        "trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of\n" +
        "money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. Once, after\n" +
        "organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself\n" +
        "by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a\n" +
        "civic duty in his spare time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Several years after Father had retired on a pension, an English\n" +
        "accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway\n" +
        "Company. The amazed investigator discovered that Father had never\n" +
        "applied for overdue bonuses.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He did the work of three men! the accountant told the company.\n" +
        "He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250). owing to him as back\n" +
        "compensation. The officials presented Father with a check for\n" +
        "this amount. He thought so little about it that he overlooked any\n" +
        "mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest\n" +
        "brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why be elated by material profit? Father replied. The one who\n" +
        "pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain\n" +
        "nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this\n" +
        "world, and departs without a single rupee.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Early in their married life, my parents became disciples of a\n" +
        "great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This contact strengthened\n" +
        "Fathers naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable\n" +
        "admission to my eldest sister Roma: Your father and myself live\n" +
        "together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having\n" +
        "children.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, \n" +
        "an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.\n" +
        "Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian\n" +
        "saints. He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior\n" +
        "glories of his own guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which\n" +
        "your father became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together\n" +
        "in the compound of my home, that he put this intriguing question.\n" +
        "I shook my head with a smile of anticipation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your\n" +
        "father-to give me a weeks leave from my Gorakhpur duties in order\n" +
        "to visit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you going to become a religious fanatic? he inquired.\n" +
        "Concentrate on your office work if you want to forge ahead.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your\n" +
        "father in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance,\n" +
        "and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed\n" +
        "out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I heard\n" +
        "him listlessly. My heart was repeating: Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot\n" +
        "live without seeing you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our path took us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays\n" +
        "of the late afternoon sun were still crowning the tall ripple of\n" +
        "the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only\n" +
        "a few yards from us, the form of my great guru suddenly appeared!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee! His voice was\n" +
        "resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he\n" +
        "had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya! Your father was motionless with stupefaction for a few\n" +
        "moments.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Abinash, not only do I give YOU leave, but I give MYSELF leave to\n" +
        "start for Benares tomorrow. I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya,\n" +
        "who is able to materialize himself at will in order to intercede\n" +
        "for you! I will take my wife and ask this master to initiate us in\n" +
        "his spiritual path. Will you guide us to him?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course. Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer,\n" +
        "and the quick, favorable turn of events.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We\n" +
        "took a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through\n" +
        "narrow lanes to my gurus secluded home. Entering his little parlor,\n" +
        "we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture.\n" +
        "He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee! His words were the\n" +
        "same as those he had used two days before in the Gorakhpur field.\n" +
        "He added, I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me,\n" +
        "and that you and your wife have accompanied him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice\n" +
        "of KRIYA YOGA. Your father and I, as brother disciples,\n" +
        "have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision.\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya took a definite interest in your own birth. Your\n" +
        "life shall surely be linked with his own: the masters blessing\n" +
        "never fails.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I had entered it.\n" +
        "His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in\n" +
        "the various cities to which Father was transferred by his office.\n" +
        "Many a morning and evening found Mother and me meditating before an\n" +
        "improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood\n" +
        "paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions,\n" +
        "we honored the divinity which had found full expression in Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew,\n" +
        "the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often\n" +
        "see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking\n" +
        "a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet\n" +
        "of his luminous body, it would change and again become the picture.\n" +
        "As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed\n" +
        "in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living,\n" +
        "enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of\n" +
        "trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At\n" +
        "first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I\n" +
        "began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He\n" +
        "had often written to those of his disciples who were over-anxious\n" +
        "to see him: Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever\n" +
        "within range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing\n" +
        "through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave\n" +
        "intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur,\n" +
        "Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired\n" +
        "of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically\n" +
        "motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasayas picture on the wall above\n" +
        "my head.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bow to him mentally! She knew I was too feeble even to lift my\n" +
        "hands in salutation. If you really show your devotion and inwardly\n" +
        "kneel before him, your life will be spared!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping\n" +
        "my body and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable\n" +
        "symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to\n" +
        "bend over and touch Mothers feet in appreciation of her immeasurable\n" +
        "faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the\n" +
        "little picture.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my\n" +
        "son!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through\n" +
        "which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given\n" +
        "to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration.\n" +
        "The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Fathers\n" +
        "brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed.\n" +
        "Over his protest, a group picture was once taken of him and\n" +
        "a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed\n" +
        "photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images\n" +
        "of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in\n" +
        "the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines\n" +
        "of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted\n" +
        "that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning,\n" +
        "as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen\n" +
        "behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every\n" +
        "precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each\n" +
        "one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but\n" +
        "once again the masters form was missing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his\n" +
        "guru. It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence\n" +
        "with a pregnant comment:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of\n" +
        "the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit\n" +
        "appears fully to dwell.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Again the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred\n" +
        "figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on\n" +
        "the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least,\n" +
        "I have seen none.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasayas fair\n" +
        "features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he\n" +
        "belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in\n" +
        "a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal\n" +
        "direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely\n" +
        "oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at\n" +
        "all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for\n" +
        "his bounty.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Shortly after my healing through the potency of the gurus picture,\n" +
        "I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning,\n" +
        "I fell into a deep reverie.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is behind the darkness of closed eyes? This probing thought\n" +
        "came powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once\n" +
        "manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in\n" +
        "meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema\n" +
        "pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Who are you? I spoke aloud.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We are the Himalayan yogis. The celestial response is difficult\n" +
        "to describe; my heart was thrilled.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you! The vision\n" +
        "vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles\n" +
        "to infinity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is this wondrous glow?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am Iswara. I am Light. The voice was as murmuring\n" +
        "clouds.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I want to be one with Thee!\n" +

        "Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for\n" +

        "in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound.\n" +
        "She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare\n" +
        "my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma\n" +
        "complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I\n" +
        "smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?\n" +

        "You little liar!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sis, dont call me a liar until you see what happens in the\n" +
        "morning. Indignation filled me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant\n" +
        "resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have\n" +
        "a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and YOUR boil\n" +
        "shall swell to twice its present size!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the\n" +
        "dimensions of Umas boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister\n" +
        "rushed to Mother. Mukunda has become a necromancer! Gravely,\n" +
        "Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing\n" +
        "harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by\n" +
        "the doctors incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a\n" +
        "constant reminder of the power in mans sheer word.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken\n" +

        "explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious, effects.\n" +
        "I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech\n" +

        "Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture\n" +
        "of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. It\n" +
        "sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An\n" +
        "unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any\n" +
        "of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma\n" +
        "one day, I watched two kites flying over the roofs of the buildings\n" +
        "on the opposite side of the very narrow lane.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why are you so quiet? Uma pushed me playfully.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Matches are played in India with kites whose strings are covered\n" +
        "with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string\n" +
        "of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is great\n" +
        "fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it\n" +
        "seemed impossible that any loosed kite could come into our hands;\n" +
        "its string would naturally dangle over the roofs.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The players across the lane began their match. One string was cut;\n" +
        "immediately the kite floated in my direction. It was stationary\n" +
        "for a moment, through sudden abatement of breeze, which sufficed\n" +
        "to firmly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the\n" +
        "opposite house. A perfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed\n" +
        "the prize to Uma.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was just an extraordinary accident, and not an answer to your\n" +
        "prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I shall believe.\n" +
        "Sisters dark eyes conveyed more amazement than her words.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug\n" +
        "by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It\n" +
        "headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the\n" +
        "cactus plant, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop\n" +
        "by which I could grasp it. I presented my second trophy to Uma.\n" +

        "My mothers greatest desire was the marriage of my elder brother.\n" +
        "Ah, when I behold the face of Anantas wife, I shall find heaven\n" +

        "her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was about eleven years old at the time of Anantas betrothal.\n" +
        "Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations.\n" +

        "two elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son,\n" +
        "plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives,\n" +
        "daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them\n" +
        "comfortably in a large, newly acquired house at 50 Amherst Street.\n" +
        "Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne\n" +
        "on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be,\n" +
        "the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Father and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family\n" +

        "I had an ominous vision.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the\n" +
        "piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of\n" +
        "the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and\n" +
        "I saw the beloved form of my mother.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Awaken your father! Her voice was only a whisper. Take the first\n" +
        "available train, at four oclock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if\n" +
        "you would see me! The wraithlike figure vanished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father, Father! Mother is dying! The terror in my tone aroused\n" +
        "him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Never mind that hallucination of yours. Father gave his characteristic\n" +
        "negation to a new situation. Your mother is in excellent health.\n" +
        "If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now! Anguish\n" +
        "caused me to add bitterly, Nor shall I ever forgive you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The melancholy morning came with explicit words: Mother dangerously\n" +
        "ill; marriage postponed; come at once.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father and I left distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route\n" +
        "at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with\n" +
        "telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination\n" +
        "arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I\n" +
        "felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to\n" +
        "the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing\n" +
        "black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of\n" +
        "childhood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Does she yet live? I stopped for one last question to my uncle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course she is alive! He was not slow to interpret the desperation\n" +
        "in my face. But I scarcely believed him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the\n" +
        "stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless\n" +
        "state. Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart.\n" +
        "Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the\n" +
        "Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating\n" +
        "wounds:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the\n" +
        "tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the\n" +
        "lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory\n" +
        "rites for the well-beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic\n" +
        "memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the\n" +
        "smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments,\n" +
        "I thought that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves\n" +
        "with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with\n" +
        "the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging\n" +
        "from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt\n" +
        "powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills,\n" +
        "visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the\n" +
        "high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us run away to the Himalayas. My suggestion one day to\n" +
        "Dwarka Prasad, the young son of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on\n" +
        "unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who\n" +
        "had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over\n" +
        "this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite\n" +
        "point to ridicule me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Where is your orange robe? You cant be a swami without that!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They brought a clear\n" +
        "picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they\n" +
        "awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with\n" +
        "what natural ease I would wear the garb of that anciently-founded\n" +
        "monastic order.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending\n" +
        "with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to\n" +
        "the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills.\n" +
        "Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to\n" +
        "Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one\n" +
        "at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers,\n" +
        "human and divine.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The rent left in the family fabric by Mothers death was irreparable.\n" +
        "Father never remarried during his nearly forty remaining years.\n" +
        "Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock,\n" +
        "he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness\n" +
        "and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office\n" +
        "hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing\n" +
        "KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity. Long after Mothers death, I attempted\n" +
        "to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my\n" +
        "parents life more comfortable. But Father shook his head.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Service to me ended with your mother. His eyes were remote with\n" +
        "a lifelong devotion. I will not accept ministrations from any\n" +
        "other woman.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Fourteen months after Mothers passing, I learned that she had left\n" +
        "me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had\n" +
        "recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be\n" +
        "made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave\n" +
        "Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him.\n" +
        " One evening he summoned me to his side.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings.\n" +
        "Anantas tone held a note of resignation. My fear was to inflame\n" +
        "your desire to leave home. But in any case you are bristling with\n" +
        "divine ardor. When I captured you recently on your way to the\n" +
        "Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone\n" +
        "the fulfillment of my solemn promise. My brother handed me a small\n" +
        "box, and delivered Mothers message.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!\n" +
        "Mother had said. The hour is here when I must relate a number of\n" +
        "phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined\n" +
        "path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to\n" +
        "the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of\n" +
        "disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep\n" +
        "meditation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "While I patted you, I was praying that the great guru take\n" +
        "notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devotional demand grew\n" +
        "in intensity, he opened his eyes and beckoned me to approach. The\n" +
        "others made a way for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My master\n" +
        "seated you on his lap, placing his hand on your forehead by way of\n" +
        "spiritually baptizing you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he\n" +
        "will carry many souls to Gods kingdom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My heart leaped with joy to find my secret prayer granted by the\n" +
        "omniscient guru. Shortly before your birth, he had told me you\n" +
        "would follow his path.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Later, my son, your vision of the Great Light was known to me and\n" +
        "your sister Roma, as from the next room we observed you motionless\n" +
        "on the bed. Your little face was illuminated; your voice rang with\n" +
        "iron resolve as you spoke of going to the Himalayas in quest of\n" +
        "the Divine.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In these ways, dear son, I came to know that your road lies far\n" +
        "from worldly ambitions. The most singular event in my life brought\n" +
        "further confirmation-an event which now impels my deathbed message.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was an interview with a sage in the Punjab. While our family\n" +
        "was living in Lahore, one morning the servant came precipitantly\n" +
        "into my room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mistress, a strange SADHU is here. He insists that he\n" +
        "see the mother of Mukunda.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These simple words struck a profound chord within me; I went at\n" +
        "once to greet the visitor. Bowing at his feet, I sensed that before\n" +
        "me was a true man of God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mother, he said, the great masters wish you to know that your\n" +
        "stay on earth will not be long. Your next illness shall prove to\n" +
        "be your last. There was a silence, during which I felt no\n" +
        "alarm but only a vibration of great peace. Finally he addressed me\n" +
        "again:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are to be the custodian of a certain silver amulet. I will\n" +
        "not give it to you today; to demonstrate the truth in my words, the\n" +
        "talisman shall materialize in your hands tomorrow as you meditate.\n" +
        "On your deathbed, you must instruct your eldest son Ananta to keep\n" +
        "the amulet for one year and then to hand it over to your second\n" +
        "son. Mukunda will understand the meaning of the talisman from the\n" +
        "great ones. He should receive it about the time he is ready to\n" +
        "renounce all worldly hopes and start his vital search for God. When\n" +
        "he has retained the amulet for some years, and when it has served\n" +
        "its purpose, it shall vanish. Even if kept in the most secret spot,\n" +
        "it shall return whence it came.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I proffered alms to the saint, and bowed before him\n" +
        "in great reverence. Not taking the offering, he departed with a\n" +
        "blessing. The next evening, as I sat with folded hands in meditation,\n" +
        "a silver amulet materialized between my palms, even as the SADHU\n" +
        "had promised. It made itself known by a cold, smooth touch. I\n" +
        "have jealously guarded it for more than two years, and now leave\n" +
        "it in Anantas keeping. Do not grieve for me, as I shall have been\n" +
        "ushered by my great guru into the arms of the Infinite. Farewell,\n" +
        "my child; the Cosmic Mother will protect you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A blaze of illumination came over me with possession of the amulet;\n" +
        "many dormant memories awakened. The talisman, round and anciently\n" +
        "quaint, was covered with Sanskrit characters. I understood that it\n" +
        "came from teachers of past lives, who were invisibly guiding my\n" +
        "steps. A further significance there was, indeed; but one does not\n" +
        "reveal fully the heart of an amulet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances\n" +
        "of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru,\n" +
        "cannot be told in this chapter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But the small boy, thwarted in his attempts to reach the Himalayas,\n" +
        "daily traveled far on the wings of his amulet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father, if I promise to return home without coercion, may I take\n" +
        "a sight-seeing trip to Benares?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted\n" +
        "me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.\n" +
        "Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we would travel\n" +
        "comfortably on first-class passes provided by Father. His position\n" +
        "as a railroad official was fully satisfactory to the nomads in the\n" +
        "family.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father promised to give my request due consideration. The next\n" +
        "day he summoned me and held out a round-trip pass from Bareilly to\n" +
        "Benares, a number of rupee notes, and two letters.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have a business matter to propose to a Benares friend, Kedar\n" +
        "Nath Babu. Unfortunately I have lost his address. But I believe you\n" +
        "will be able to get this letter to him through our common friend,\n" +
        "Swami Pranabananda. The swami, my brother disciple, has attained\n" +
        "an exalted spiritual stature. You will benefit by his company; this\n" +
        "second note will serve as your introduction.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Fathers eyes twinkled as he added, Mind, no more flights from\n" +
        "home!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I set forth with the zest of my twelve years (though time has\n" +
        "never dimmed my delight in new scenes and strange faces). Reaching\n" +
        "Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swamis residence. The\n" +
        "front door was open; I made my way to a long, hall-like room on\n" +
        "the second floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was\n" +
        "seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and\n" +
        "unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about\n" +
        "his lips. To dispel my thought that I had intruded, he greeted me\n" +
        "as an old friend.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "BABA ANAND (bliss to my dear one). His welcome was given heartily\n" +
        "in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you Swami Pranabananda?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He nodded. Are you Bhagabatis son? His words were out before I\n" +
        "had had time to get Fathers letter from my pocket. In astonishment,\n" +
        "I handed him the note of introduction, which now seemed superfluous.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you. The saint again\n" +
        "surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at the letter, and\n" +
        "made a few affectionate references to my parent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You know, I am enjoying two pensions. One is by the recommendation\n" +
        "of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The\n" +
        "other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father, for whom I\n" +
        "have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I found this remark very obscure. What kind of pension, sir, do\n" +
        "you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your\n" +
        "lap?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He laughed. I mean a pension of fathomless peace-a reward for many\n" +
        "years of deep meditation. I never crave money now. My few material\n" +
        "needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the\n" +
        "significance of a second pension.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely\n" +
        "motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At first his eyes\n" +
        "sparkled, as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I\n" +
        "felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not yet told me how I could\n" +
        "meet Fathers friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in\n" +
        "the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze took in his\n" +
        "wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Little sir, dont get worried. The man you wish to see\n" +
        "will be with you in half an hour. The yogi was reading my mind-a\n" +
        "feat not too difficult at the moment!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that\n" +
        "thirty minutes had elapsed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The swami aroused himself. I think Kedar Nath Babu is nearing the\n" +
        "door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I heard somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension\n" +
        "arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: How is it possible\n" +
        "that Fathers friend has been summoned to this place without the\n" +
        "help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no one but myself\n" +
        "since my arrival!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down\n" +
        "I met a thin, fair-skinned man of medium height. He appeared to be\n" +
        "in a hurry.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you Kedar Nath Babu? Excitement colored my voice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes. Are you not Bhagabatis son who has been waiting here to meet\n" +
        "me? He smiled in friendly fashion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, how do you happen to come here? I felt baffled resentment\n" +
        "over his inexplicable presence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just\n" +
        "finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranabananda approached\n" +
        "me. I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bhagabatis son is waiting for you in my apartment, he said.\n" +
        "Will you come with me? I gladly agreed. As we proceeded hand in\n" +
        "hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace\n" +
        "me, though I wore these stout walking shoes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How long will it take you to reach my place? Pranabanandaji\n" +
        "suddenly halted to ask me this question.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "About half an hour.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have something else to do at present. He gave me an enigmatical\n" +
        "glance. I must leave you behind. You can join me in my house,\n" +
        "where Bhagabatis son and I will be awaiting you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Before I could remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared\n" +
        "in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how\n" +
        "long he had known the swami.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We met a few times last year, but not recently. I was very glad\n" +
        "to see him again today at the bathing GHAT.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I cannot believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him\n" +
        "in a vision, or did you actually see him, touch his hand, and hear\n" +
        "the sound of his feet?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I dont know what youre driving at! He flushed angrily. I am\n" +
        "not lying to you. Cant you understand that only through the swami\n" +
        "could I have known you were waiting at this place for me?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, has not left my sight a moment\n" +
        "since I first came about an hour ago. I blurted out the whole\n" +
        "story.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His eyes opened widely. Are we living in this material age, or\n" +
        "are we dreaming? I never expected to witness such a miracle in my\n" +
        "life! I thought this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I find\n" +
        "he can materialize an extra body and work through it! Together we\n" +
        "entered the saints room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Look, those are the very sandals he was wearing at the GHAT,\n" +
        "Kedar Nath Babu whispered. He was clad only in a loincloth, just\n" +
        "as I see him now.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the visitor bowed before him, the saint turned to me with a\n" +
        "quizzical smile.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why are you stupefied at all this? The subtle unity of the phenomenal\n" +
        "world is not hidden from true yogis. I instantly see and converse\n" +
        "with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly transcend\n" +
        "at will every obstacle of gross matter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was probably in an effort to stir spiritual ardor in my young\n" +
        "breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of\n" +
        "astral radio and television. But instead of enthusiasm, I\n" +
        "experienced only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined\n" +
        "to undertake my divine search through one particular guru-Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar, whom I had not yet met-I felt no inclination to accept\n" +
        "Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfully, wondering\n" +
        "if it were he or his counterpart before me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The master sought to banish my disquietude by bestowing a soul-awakening\n" +
        "gaze, and by some inspiring words about his guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya was the greatest yogi I ever knew. He was Divinity\n" +
        "Itself in the form of flesh.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If a disciple, I reflected, could materialize an extra fleshly form\n" +
        "at will, what miracles indeed could be barred to his master?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will tell you how priceless is a gurus help. I used to meditate\n" +
        "with another disciple for eight hours every night. We had to work at\n" +
        "the railroad office during the day. Finding difficulty in carrying\n" +
        "on my clerical duties, I desired to devote my whole time to God.\n" +
        "For eight years I persevered, meditating half the night. I had\n" +
        "wonderful results; tremendous spiritual perceptions illumined my\n" +
        "mind. But a little veil always remained between me and the Infinite.\n" +
        "Even with super-human earnestness, I found the final irrevocable\n" +
        "union to be denied me. One evening I paid a visit to Lahiri Mahasaya\n" +
        "and pleaded for his divine intercession. My importunities continued\n" +
        "during the entire night.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Angelic Guru, my spiritual anguish is such that I can no longer\n" +
        "bear my life without meeting the Great Beloved face to face!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What can I do? You must meditate more profoundly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am appealing to Thee, O God my Master! I see Thee materialized\n" +
        "before me in a physical body; bless me that I may perceive Thee in\n" +
        "Thine infinite form!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya extended his hand in a benign gesture. You may\n" +
        "go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In meditation that\n" +
        "night, the burning Goal of my life was achieved. Now I ceaselessly\n" +
        "enjoy the spiritual pension. Never from that day has the Blissful\n" +
        "Creator remained hidden from my eyes behind any screen of delusion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Pranabanandas face was suffused with divine light. The peace of\n" +
        "another world entered my heart; all fear had fled. The saint made\n" +
        "a further confidence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to\n" +
        "thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned\n" +
        "another matter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Divine Guru, I can no longer work in the office. Please release\n" +
        "me. Brahma keeps me continuously intoxicated.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Apply for a pension from your company.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What reason shall I give, so early in my service?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Say what you feel.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The next day I made my application. The doctor inquired the grounds\n" +
        "for my premature request.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At work, I find an overpowering sensation rising in my spine.\n" +
        " It permeates my whole body, unfitting me for the performance\n" +
        "of my duties.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Without further questioning the physician recommended me highly\n" +
        "for a pension, which I soon received. I know the divine will of\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya worked through the doctor and the railroad officials,\n" +
        "including your father. Automatically they obeyed the great gurus\n" +
        "spiritual direction, and freed me for a life of unbroken communion\n" +
        "with the Beloved. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "After this extraordinary revelation, Swami Pranabananda retired\n" +
        "into one of his long silences. As I was taking leave, touching his\n" +
        "feet reverently, he gave me his blessing:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your life belongs to the path of renunciation and yoga. I shall\n" +
        "see you again, with your father, later on. The years brought\n" +
        "fulfillment to both these predictions. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kedar Nath Babu walked by my side in the gathering darkness. I\n" +
        "delivered Fathers letter, which my companion read under a street\n" +
        "lamp.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your father suggests that I take a position in the Calcutta office\n" +
        "of his railroad company. How pleasant to look forward to at least\n" +
        "one of the pensions that Swami Pranabananda enjoys! But it is\n" +
        "impossible; I cannot leave Benares. Alas, two bodies are not yet\n" +
        "for me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney\n" +
        "carriage. Stop in the lane where no one in my house can see you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school\n" +
        "friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen\n" +
        "the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary,\n" +
        "as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the\n" +
        "plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The\n" +
        "amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me.\n" +
        "Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find the master whose face\n" +
        "often appeared to me in visions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been\n" +
        "permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom,\n" +
        "Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar\n" +
        "Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations\n" +
        "and prepared my mind for the divine search.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the\n" +
        "wheels of Amars carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a\n" +
        "blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasayas picture, a copy of\n" +
        "the BHAGAVAD GITA, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths.\n" +
        "This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the\n" +
        "steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is the excitement? His gaze roved suspiciously over my\n" +
        "person.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving\n" +
        "my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to\n" +
        "Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving\n" +
        "our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever\n" +
        "brother could easily play the part of a detective, we thought to\n" +
        "outwit him by European garb.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh,\n" +
        "whom I called Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru\n" +
        "in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness.\n" +
        "Well-camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All we need now are canvas shoes. I led my companions to a shop\n" +
        "displaying rubber-soled footwear. Articles of leather, gotten\n" +
        "only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy\n" +
        "trip. I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my\n" +
        "BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my English-made SOLA\n" +
        "TOPEE (helmet).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to\n" +
        "transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the\n" +
        "train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of\n" +
        "my glorious anticipations.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Just imagine! I ejaculated. We shall be initiated by the masters\n" +
        "and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will\n" +
        "be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas\n" +
        "will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek house\n" +
        "cats awaiting our caresses!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both\n" +
        "metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from\n" +
        "Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window\n" +
        "at the scampering landscape.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let the money be divided in three portions. Jatinda broke a long\n" +
        "silence with this suggestion. Each of us should buy his own ticket\n" +
        "at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are\n" +
        "running away together.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.\n" +
        "Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform.\n" +
        "We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching\n" +
        "in all directions, we shouted Jatindas name with the urgency\n" +
        "of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the\n" +
        "little station.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God\n" +
        "would countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion\n" +
        "of my first carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amar, we must return home. I was weeping like a child. Jatindas\n" +
        "callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Is this your love for the Lord? Cant you stand the little test\n" +
        "of a treacherous companion?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Through Amars suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied\n" +
        "itself. We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats,\n" +
        "SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet\n" +
        "pearl). In a few hours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly.\n" +
        "Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital matter as we\n" +
        "waited on the platform.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.\n" +
        "I am not underrating my brothers ingenuity! No matter what the\n" +
        "outcome, I will not speak untruth.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Dont laugh or grin\n" +
        "while I am talking.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a\n" +
        "telegram whose import I immediately grasped.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you running away from home in anger?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No! I was glad his choice of words permitted me to make emphatic\n" +
        "reply. Not anger but divinest melancholy was responsible, I knew,\n" +
        "for my unconventional behavior.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed\n" +
        "hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Where is the third boy? The man injected a full ring of authority\n" +
        "into his voice. Come on; speak the truth!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Cant you see that\n" +
        "we are only two? Amar smiled impudently. I am not a magician; I\n" +
        "cant conjure up a third companion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought\n" +
        "a new field of attack.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is your name?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a\n" +
        "converted Christian Indian father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is your friends name?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I call him Thompson.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "By this time my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously\n" +
        "made for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with\n" +
        "the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into\n" +
        "a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of two\n" +
        "half-English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After\n" +
        "his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably.\n" +
        "My friend wore an expression of blithe satisfaction at having\n" +
        "outwitted a veteran European official.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother,\n" +
        "it went thus: Three Bengali boys in English clothes running away\n" +
        "from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until\n" +
        "my arrival. Ample reward for your services.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home. My\n" +
        "glance was reproachful. Brother must have found one there.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My friend sheepishly acknowledged the thrust. We halted briefly\n" +
        "in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from\n" +
        "Ananta. My old friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him\n" +
        "that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous\n" +
        "occasion, Dwarka refused my invitation to set forth to the Himalayas.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep,\n" +
        "Amar was awakened by another questioning official. He, too, fell a\n" +
        "victim to the hybrid charms of Thomas and Thompson. The train\n" +
        "bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic\n" +
        "mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the\n" +
        "station and entered the freedom of city crowds. Our first act was\n" +
        "to change into native costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated\n" +
        "our European disguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to\n" +
        "proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many\n" +
        "masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on\n" +
        "the platform. He was brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a\n" +
        "policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow\n" +
        "and took charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was\n" +
        "his duty to hold us until my elder brother arrived.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Learning that the truants destination had been the Himalayas, the\n" +
        "officer related a strange story.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater\n" +
        "man of God than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer\n" +
        "and I first encountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the\n" +
        "Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions\n" +
        "were to capture him, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading\n" +
        "as a SADHU in order to rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we\n" +
        "spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He\n" +
        "ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him. Approaching\n" +
        "his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the mans right\n" +
        "arm was severed almost completely from his body.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger\n" +
        "astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of\n" +
        "him, he spoke quietly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am not the murderer you are seeking.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was deeply mortified to see I had injured the person of a\n" +
        "divine--looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored\n" +
        "his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts\n" +
        "of blood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part. The\n" +
        "saint regarded me kindly. Run along, and dont reproach yourself.\n" +
        "The Beloved Mother is taking care of me. He pushed his dangling\n" +
        "arm into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased\n" +
        "to flow.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come to me under yonder tree in three days and you will find me\n" +
        "fully healed. Thus you will feel no remorse.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yesterday my brother officer and I went eagerly to the designated\n" +
        "spot. The SADHU was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It\n" +
        "bore no scar or trace of hurt!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes. He blessed\n" +
        "us as he departed quickly. I feel that my life has been uplifted\n" +
        "through his sanctity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had\n" +
        "obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive\n" +
        "gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In\n" +
        "the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not\n" +
        "missing, alas! even in India), the reporters version was slightly\n" +
        "exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amar and I lamented that we had missed the great yogi who could\n" +
        "forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. India, materially\n" +
        "poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of\n" +
        "divine wealth; spiritual skyscrapers may occasionally be encountered\n" +
        "by the wayside, even by worldly men like this policeman.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous\n" +
        "story. He was probably intimating that he was more fortunate than\n" +
        "we: he had met an illumined saint without effort; our earnest search\n" +
        "had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police\n" +
        "station!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So near the Himalayas and yet, in our captivity, so far, I told\n" +
        "Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us slip away when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to\n" +
        "holy Rishikesh. I smiled encouragingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop\n" +
        "of our money had been taken from us.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should\n" +
        "finish, not in the city of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ananta and Amars brother arrived after three days. Amar greeted\n" +
        "his relative with affectionate relief. I was unreconciled; Ananta\n" +
        "got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I understand how you feel. My brother spoke soothingly. All I\n" +
        "ask of you is to accompany me to Benares to meet a certain saint,\n" +
        "and go on to Calcutta to visit your grieving father for a few days.\n" +
        "Then you can resume your search here for a master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention\n" +
        "of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying the familial\n" +
        "warmth. But I knew I would never abandon the quest for my guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant\n" +
        "response to my prayers.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me\n" +
        "at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a certain scriptural\n" +
        "authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his son had\n" +
        "promised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ananta took me to their home. The son, a young man of ebullient\n" +
        "manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy\n" +
        "philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant knowledge\n" +
        "of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if\n" +
        "you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You cannot\n" +
        "work out your past karma without worldly experiences.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Krishnas immortal words rose to my lips in reply: Even he with\n" +
        "the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me quickly loses\n" +
        "the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high-souled being,\n" +
        "he soon attains perennial peace. Arjuna, know this for certain:\n" +
        "the devotee who puts his trust in Me never perishes! \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But the forceful prognostications of the young man had slightly\n" +
        "shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of my heart I prayed\n" +
        "silently to God:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if\n" +
        "Thou dost desire me to lead the life of a renunciate or a worldly\n" +
        "man!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside\n" +
        "the compound of the pundits house. Evidently he had overheard\n" +
        "the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and\n" +
        "myself, for the stranger called me to his side. I felt a tremendous\n" +
        "power flowing from his calm eyes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, dont listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer,\n" +
        "the Lord tells me to assure you that your sole path in this life\n" +
        "is that of the renunciate.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With astonishment as well as gratitude, I smiled happily at this\n" +
        "decisive message.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come away from that man! The ignoramus was calling me from the\n" +
        "courtyard. My saintly guide raised his hand in blessing and slowly\n" +
        "departed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That SADHU is just as crazy as you are. It was the hoary-headed\n" +
        "pundit who made this charming observation. He and his son were\n" +
        "gazing at me lugubriously. I heard that he too has left his home\n" +
        "in a vague search for God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I turned away. To Ananta I remarked that I would not engage in\n" +
        "further discussion with our hosts. My brother agreed to an immediate\n" +
        "departure; we soon entrained for Calcutta.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mr Detective, how did you discover I had fled with two companions?\n" +
        "I vented my lively curiosity to Ananta during our homeward journey.\n" +
        "He smiled mischievously.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At your school, I found that Amar had left his classroom and had\n" +
        "not returned. I went to his home the next morning and unearthed a\n" +
        "marked timetable. Amars father was just leaving by carriage and\n" +
        "was talking to the coachman.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My son will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has\n" +
        "disappeared! the father moaned.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I heard from a brother coachman that your son and two others,\n" +
        "dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,\n" +
        "the man stated. They made a present of their leather shoes to the\n" +
        "cab driver.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thus I had three clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the\n" +
        "English clothing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was listening to Anantas disclosures with mingled mirth and\n" +
        "vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all\n" +
        "the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked\n" +
        "Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries\n" +
        "in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had\n" +
        "been absent one night but had arrived home the following morning\n" +
        "in European garb. I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He\n" +
        "accepted, quite disarmed by my friendly manner. On the way I led him\n" +
        "unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several\n" +
        "officers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious\n" +
        "appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to account\n" +
        "for his mysterious conduct.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant spiritual mood, he\n" +
        "explained. Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the\n" +
        "masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, During our ecstasies in the\n" +
        "Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us like\n" +
        "tame pussies, my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on\n" +
        "my brow. What then? I thought. If the vicious nature of the\n" +
        "tigers be not changed through the power of our spiritual trance,\n" +
        "shall they treat us with the kindness of house cats? In my minds\n" +
        "eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tigers\n" +
        "stomach-entering there not at once with the whole body, but by\n" +
        "installments of its several parts!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My anger at Jatindas vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The\n" +
        "hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the anguish he had\n" +
        "caused me. I must confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction:\n" +
        "Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ananta, you are a born sleuthhound! My glance of amusement\n" +
        "was not without some exasperation. And I shall tell Jatinda I am\n" +
        "glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but\n" +
        "only by the prudent instinct of self-preservation!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At home in Calcutta, Father touchingly requested me to curb my roving\n" +
        "feet until, at least, the completion of my high school studies.\n" +
        "In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for\n" +
        "a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, to come regularly to\n" +
        "the house.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor, my parent announced\n" +
        "confidently.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions\n" +
        "from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my\n" +
        "new teacher, far from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the\n" +
        "embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda\n" +
        "was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had\n" +
        "possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the\n" +
        "irresistibility of his divine magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined\n" +
        "sage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Luxuriant curls framed my tutors handsome face. His dark eyes were\n" +
        "guileless, with the transparency of a childs. All the movements of\n" +
        "his slight body were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle\n" +
        "and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness.\n" +
        "Many of our happy hours together were spent in deep KRIYA meditation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred\n" +
        "books: his erudition had earned him the title of Shastri Mahasaya,\n" +
        "by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit\n" +
        "scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake\n" +
        "prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor\n" +
        "obliged me one day by telling me something of his own life with\n" +
        "the master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for\n" +
        "ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilgrimage. The\n" +
        "guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor.\n" +
        "As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples\n" +
        "garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced with\n" +
        "the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through\n" +
        "the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of eternal bliss. He seldom\n" +
        "spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze would focus on a student in\n" +
        "need of help; healing words poured then like an avalanche of light.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An indescribable peace blossomed within me at the masters glance.\n" +
        "I was permeated with his fragrance, as though from a lotus of\n" +
        "infinity. To be with him, even without exchanging a word for days,\n" +
        "was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible\n" +
        "barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I would meditate at\n" +
        "the gurus feet. There the most tenuous states came easily within\n" +
        "my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in the presence of lesser\n" +
        "teachers. The master was a living temple of God whose secret doors\n" +
        "were open to all disciples through devotion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures.\n" +
        "Effortlessly he dipped into the divine library. Foam of words and\n" +
        "spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He\n" +
        "had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical\n" +
        "science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. If asked to explain\n" +
        "the different planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient\n" +
        "texts, he would smilingly assent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I\n" +
        "perceive. He was thus diametrically unlike the teachers who commit\n" +
        "scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please expound the holy stanzas as the meaning occurs to you.\n" +
        "The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near-by disciple.\n" +
        "I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be\n" +
        "uttered. In this way many of Lahiri Mahasayas perceptions came\n" +
        "to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The master never counseled slavish belief. Words are only shells,\n" +
        "he said. Win conviction of Gods presence through your own joyous\n" +
        "contact in meditation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No matter what the disciples problem, the guru advised KRIYA YOGA\n" +
        "for its solution.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer\n" +
        "present in the body to guide you. This technique cannot be bound,\n" +
        "filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations.\n" +
        "Continue ceaselessly on your path to liberation through KRIYA,\n" +
        "whose power lies in practice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through\n" +
        "self-effort ever to be evolved in mans search for the Infinite.\n" +
        "Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. Through its use,\n" +
        "the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated\n" +
        "in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number of his disciples.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya took place in Kebalanandas\n" +
        "presence. My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his eyes\n" +
        "remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no\n" +
        "light in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master, in whom\n" +
        "the Divine was fully blazing? One morning I sought to speak to\n" +
        "Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made\n" +
        "palm-leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally left the room, I followed\n" +
        "him.\n" +

        "Many members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his followers.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each\n" +

        "vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume,\n" +

        "it; a negative psychological effect ensues which in time deranges\n" +
        "the brain cells. Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of\n" +

        "gaily. After much vain hunting in Bhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we\n" +
        "arrived at the right house. The door held two iron rings, which I\n" +
        "sounded piercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached\n" +
        "with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied that visitors,\n" +
        "despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a\n" +
        "saints home.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Feeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be\n" +
        "invited into the parlor. Our long wait there caused uncomfortable\n" +
        "misgivings. Indias unwritten law for the truth seeker is patience;\n" +
        "a master may purposely make a test of ones eagerness to meet him.\n" +
        "This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West by doctors\n" +
        "and dentists!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Finally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping\n" +
        "apartment. The famous Sohong Swami was seated on his bed.\n" +
        "The sight of his tremendous body affected us strangely. With bulging\n" +
        "eyes, we stood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or\n" +
        "such football-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swamis fierce\n" +
        "yet calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache.\n" +
        "A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes.\n" +
        "He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing\n" +
        "our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with\n" +
        "bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tigers. I could do it today\n" +
        "if necessary. He gave a childlike laugh. You look upon tigers as\n" +
        "tigers; I know them as pussycats.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the\n" +
        "thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe\n" +
        "it?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course strength also is necessary! One cannot expect victory\n" +
        "from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a house cat! Powerful hands\n" +
        "are my sufficient weapon.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge\n" +
        "of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly\n" +
        "through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in\n" +
        "astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall\n" +
        "with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth\n" +
        "of tigers!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A number of men have physical power such as mine, but still lack\n" +
        "in cool confidence. Those who are bodily but not mentally stalwart\n" +
        "may find themselves fainting at mere sight of a wild beast bounding\n" +
        "freely in the jungle. The tiger in its natural ferocity and habitat\n" +
        "is vastly different from the opium-fed circus animal!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Many a man with herculean strength has nonetheless been terrorized\n" +
        "into abject helplessness before the onslaught of a royal Bengal.\n" +
        "Thus the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a state\n" +
        "as nerveless as the pussycats. It is possible for a man, owning a\n" +
        "fairly strong body and an immensely strong determination, to turn\n" +
        "the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat\n" +
        "defenselessness. How often I have done just that!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to\n" +
        "perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic\n" +
        "mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends\n" +
        "on the energy applied; the power expressed by a mans bodily instrument\n" +
        "depends on his aggressive will and courage. The body is literally\n" +
        "manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts\n" +
        "from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into\n" +
        "human consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify\n" +
        "into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has\n" +
        "mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound body thwarts\n" +
        "the mind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a servant,\n" +
        "the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is similarly enslaved by\n" +
        "submitting to bodily dictation.\n" +

        "my body was feeble.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible\n" +
        "that this man, now with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear, could\n" +
        "ever have known weakness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and\n" +
        "strength that I overcame my handicap. I have every reason to extol\n" +
        "the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer\n" +
        "of royal Bengals.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers? This\n" +
        "was the first, and the last, time that the bizarre ambition ever\n" +
        "visited my mind!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes. He was smiling. But there are many kinds of tigers; some\n" +
        "roam in jungles of human desires. No spiritual benefit accrues\n" +
        "by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner\n" +
        "prowlers.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to\n" +
        "a tamer of wild passions?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness came into his gaze,\n" +
        "summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental\n" +
        "struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled\n" +
        "in acquiescence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When my fame reached a zenith, it brought the intoxication of\n" +
        "pride. I decided not only to fight tigers but to display them in\n" +
        "various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to behave\n" +
        "like domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with\n" +
        "gratifying success.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One evening my father entered my room in pensive mood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, I have words of warning. I would save you from coming ills,\n" +
        "produced by the grinding wheels of cause and effect.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you a fatalist, Father? Should superstition be allowed to\n" +
        "discolor the powerful waters or my activities?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in the just law of retribution,\n" +
        "as taught in the holy scriptures. There is resentment against you\n" +
        "in the jungle family; sometime it may act to your cost.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father, you astonish me! You well know what tigers are-beautiful\n" +
        "but merciless! Even immediately after an enormous meal of some\n" +
        "hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of new\n" +
        "prey. It may be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass.\n" +
        "Capturing it and biting an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent\n" +
        "beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes\n" +
        "its wanton way.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows?\n" +
        "my blows may inject some slight sanity of consideration into their\n" +
        "thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach\n" +
        "them gentle manners!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please, Father, think of me as tiger tamer and never as tiger\n" +
        "killer. How could my good actions bring ill upon me? I beg you not\n" +
        "to impose any command that I change my way of life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Chandi and I were all attention, understanding the past dilemma.\n" +
        "In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents wishes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In stoic silence Father listened to my explanation. He followed\n" +
        "it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips\n" +
        "of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in\n" +
        "my daily meditation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dear friend, I come with a message for your belligerent son. Let\n" +
        "him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next tiger-encounter\n" +
        "shall result in his severe wounds, followed by six months of deathly\n" +
        "sickness. He shall then forsake his former ways and become a monk.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This tale did not impress me. I considered that Father had been\n" +
        "the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Tiger Swami made this confession with an impatient gesture, as\n" +
        "though at some stupidity. Grimly silent for a long time, he seemed\n" +
        "oblivious of our presence. When he took up the dangling thread of\n" +
        "his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Not long after Fathers warning, I visited the capital city of\n" +
        "Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was new to me, and I expected\n" +
        "a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me\n" +
        "on the streets. I would catch bits of whispered comment:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This is the man who fights wild tigers.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Has he legs, or tree-trunks?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Look at his face! He must be an incarnation of the king of tigers\n" +
        "himself!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You know how village urchins function like final editions of a\n" +
        "newspaper! With what speed do the even-later speech-bulletins of\n" +
        "the women circulate from house to house! Within a few hours, the\n" +
        "whole city was in a state of excitement over my presence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I heard the hoofbeats\n" +
        "of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place.\n" +
        "In came a number of tall, turbaned policemen.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was taken aback. All things are possible unto these creatures\n" +
        "of human law, I thought. I wonder if they are going to take me to\n" +
        "task about matters utterly unknown to me. But the officers bowed\n" +
        "with unwonted courtesy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince\n" +
        "of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow\n" +
        "morning.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure reason I\n" +
        "felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the\n" +
        "suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was bewildered the next day to be obsequiously escorted from my\n" +
        "door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held\n" +
        "an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I\n" +
        "enjoyed the pleasant ride through the city and its woodland outskirts.\n" +
        "The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He\n" +
        "proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in\n" +
        "a chair of simpler design.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All this politeness is certainly going to cost me something! I\n" +
        "thought in mounting astonishment. The princes motive emerged after\n" +
        "a few casual remarks.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My city is filled with the rumor that you can fight wild tigers\n" +
        "with nothing more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is quite true.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured\n" +
        "on the white rice of city folk. Be frank, please; have you not been\n" +
        "fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals? His voice was loud\n" +
        "and sarcastic, tinged with provincial accent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I challenge you to fight my newly-caught tiger, Raja Begum.\n" +
        " If you can successfully resist him, bind him with a chain,\n" +
        "and leave his cage in a conscious state, you shall have this royal\n" +
        "Bengal! Several thousand rupees and many other gifts shall also be\n" +
        "bestowed. If you refuse to meet him in combat, I shall blazon your\n" +
        "name throughout the state as an impostor!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His insolent words struck me like a volley of bullets. I shot an\n" +
        "angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement, the\n" +
        "prince sank back with a sadistic smile. I was reminded of the Roman\n" +
        "emperors who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The match will be set for a week hence. I regret that I cannot\n" +
        "give you permission to view the tiger in advance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Whether the prince feared I might seek to hypnotize the beast, or\n" +
        "secretly feed him opium, I know not!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I left the palace, noting with amusement that the royal umbrella\n" +
        "and panoplied coach were now missing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following week I methodically prepared my mind and body for\n" +
        "the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales.\n" +
        "The saints direful prediction to my father had somehow got abroad,\n" +
        "enlarging as it ran. Many simple villagers believed that an evil\n" +
        "spirit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which took\n" +
        "various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal\n" +
        "during the day. This demon-tiger was supposed to be the one sent\n" +
        "to humble me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger\n" +
        "Heaven had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was\n" +
        "to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting\n" +
        "to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless man daring\n" +
        "to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated\n" +
        "venom of all humiliated tigers-the villagers declared-had gathered\n" +
        "momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and bring about the fall\n" +
        "of the proud tiger tamer.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element\n" +
        "as manager of the bout between man and beast. He had supervised\n" +
        "the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate\n" +
        "thousands. Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage,\n" +
        "surrounded by an outer safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless\n" +
        "series of blood-curdling roars. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a\n" +
        "wrathful appetite. Perhaps the prince expected me to be the meal\n" +
        "of reward!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Crowds from the city and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response\n" +
        "to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The day of\n" +
        "battle saw hundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many men broke\n" +
        "through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the Tiger Swamis story approached a climax, my excitement\n" +
        "mounted with it; Chandi also was raptly mute.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub\n" +
        "of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily\n" +
        "clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I\n" +
        "opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked\n" +
        "it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous\n" +
        "crash on his bars, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience\n" +
        "was hushed with pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging\n" +
        "beast.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja\n" +
        "Begum was headlong upon me. My right hand was desperately torn.\n" +
        "Human blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling\n" +
        "streams. The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury\n" +
        "I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by\n" +
        "thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a\n" +
        "bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear\n" +
        "of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic\n" +
        "punishment rained on his head.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Raja Begums taste of blood had acted like the maddening first\n" +
        "sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening\n" +
        "roar, the brutes assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense\n" +
        "of only one hand left me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I\n" +
        "dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled\n" +
        "as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in\n" +
        "all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the\n" +
        "bestial throat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Shoot him! Kill the tiger! Shrieks arose from the audience.\n" +
        "So fast did man and beast move, that a guards bullet went amiss.\n" +
        "I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final\n" +
        "concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Like a pussycat! I interjected.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the\n" +
        "engrossing tale.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further\n" +
        "humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his\n" +
        "jaws. For a dramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning\n" +
        "deathtrap. I looked around for a chain. Pulling one from a pile\n" +
        "on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In\n" +
        "triumph I moved toward the door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his\n" +
        "supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped\n" +
        "the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I\n" +
        "fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under\n" +
        "merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness.\n" +
        "This time I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowds\n" +
        "cheer broke as though from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously\n" +
        "mauled, I had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight-stunning\n" +
        "the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him without\n" +
        "requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically\n" +
        "injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content\n" +
        "to overlook the opportune prize of my head in his mouth!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of\n" +

        "have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions\n" +
        "of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory\n" +
        "method had been found to study the passages of the impulses along\n" +
        "the nerve fibers in living animals or man because of the great\n" +

        "in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single\n" +
        "nerve fibers. Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being\n" +
        "excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way,\n" +
        "except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man.\n" +
        "The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much\n" +

        "to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment\n" +
        "was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly\n" +

        "speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his souls\n" +
        "simplicity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My Master told me so. Shrinking from personal assertion, the\n" +
        "saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable tribute. So deep\n" +
        "was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer\n" +
        "considered his thoughts as his own.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Hand in hand, the saint and I walked one evening on the block of his\n" +
        "school. My joy was dimmed by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance\n" +
        "who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see this man doesnt please you. The saints whisper to me was\n" +
        "unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologue. I have\n" +
        "spoken to Divine Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament.\n" +
        "As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind\n" +
        "him of more urgent business.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My eyes were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate,\n" +
        "the man unaccountably turned and departed, neither finishing his\n" +
        "sentence nor saying good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with\n" +
        "peace.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Another day found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station.\n" +
        "I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group\n" +
        "of men with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How undevotionally they use the Lords divine name in mechanical\n" +
        "repetition, I reflected. My gaze was astonished by the rapid\n" +
        "approach of Master Mahasaya. Sir, how come you here?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. Isnt it\n" +
        "true, little sir, that the Beloveds name sounds sweet from all\n" +
        "lips, ignorant or wise? He passed his arm around me affectionately;\n" +
        "I found myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Would you like to see some bioscopes? This question one afternoon\n" +
        "from Master Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then used in India\n" +
        "to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in\n" +
        "any circumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fronting\n" +
        "Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI\n" +
        "or pond.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us sit here for a few minutes. My Master always asked me\n" +
        "to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity\n" +
        "reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all things can be\n" +
        "reflected in water, so the whole universe is mirrored in the lake\n" +
        "of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Soon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress.\n" +
        "It proved abysmally dull, though varied occasionally by lantern\n" +
        "slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So this is the kind of bioscope the master wanted me to see! My\n" +
        "thought was impatient, yet I would not hurt the saint by revealing\n" +
        "boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see, little sir, that you dont like this bioscope. I have\n" +
        "mentioned it to Divine Mother; She is in full sympathy with us\n" +
        "both. She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and\n" +
        "wont be relit until we have a chance to leave the room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As his whisper ended, the hall was plunged into darkness. The\n" +
        "professors strident voice was stilled in astonishment, then remarked,\n" +
        "The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective. By\n" +
        "this time, Master Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold.\n" +
        "Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our\n" +
        "martyrdom had again become illuminated.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, but I\n" +
        "think you will like a different one. The saint and I were standing\n" +
        "on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently\n" +
        "slapped my chest over the heart.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern talkies become\n" +
        "inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of\n" +
        "order, so the Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the\n" +
        "earthly bustle. The pedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars,\n" +
        "automobiles, bullock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were\n" +
        "all in noiseless transit. As though possessing an omnipresent eye,\n" +
        "I beheld the scenes which were behind me, and to each side, as\n" +
        "easily as those in front. The whole spectacle of activity in that\n" +
        "small section of Calcutta passed before me without a sound. Like\n" +
        "a glow of fire dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow\n" +
        "luminescence permeated the panoramic view.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My own body seemed nothing more than one of the many shadows,\n" +
        "though it was motionless, while the others flitted mutely to and\n" +
        "fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though\n" +
        "they had looked directly at me, it was without recognition.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank\n" +
        "deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another\n" +
        "soft blow from Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the world burst\n" +
        "upon my unwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awakened\n" +
        "from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my\n" +
        "reach.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking.\n" +
        "The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground\n" +
        "before him. You cant do that to me now; you know God is in your\n" +
        "temple also! I wont let Divine Mother touch my feet through your\n" +
        "hands!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If anyone observed the unpretentious master and myself as we walked\n" +
        "away from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected\n" +
        "us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening\n" +
        "were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from\n" +
        "its nightly swoon, I faced the new morning bereft of my ecstatic\n" +
        "mood. But ever enshrined in memory is the seraphic son of Divine\n" +
        "Mother-Master Mahasaya!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Trying with poor words to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if\n" +
        "Master Mahasaya, and others among the deep-visioned saints whose\n" +
        "paths crossed mine, knew that years later, in a Western land,\n" +
        "I would be writing about their lives as divine devotees. Their\n" +
        "foreknowledge would not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who\n" +
        "have come thus far with me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Faith in God can produce any miracle except one-passing an\n" +
        "examination without study. Distastefully I closed the book I had\n" +
        "picked up in an idle moment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The writers exception shows his complete lack of faith, I thought.\n" +
        "Poor chap, he has great respect for the midnight oil!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My promise to Father had been that I would complete my high school\n" +
        "studies. I cannot pretend to diligence. The passing months found me\n" +
        "less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the\n" +
        "Calcutta bathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially\n" +
        "gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi.\n" +
        "He who would find the Deathless Essence must not be dismayed by a\n" +
        "few unadorned skulls. Human inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy\n" +
        "abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils were thus of a\n" +
        "different nature from the scholars.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast\n" +
        "approaching. This interrogatory period, like the sepulchral haunts,\n" +
        "inspires a well-known terror. My mind was nevertheless at peace.\n" +
        "Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a knowledge not found in lecture\n" +
        "halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda, who easily\n" +
        "appeared in two places at one time. My educational dilemma was\n" +
        "plainly a matter for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning,\n" +
        "though to many it seems illogic. The devotees irrationality springs\n" +
        "from a thousand inexplicable demonstrations of Gods instancy in\n" +
        "trouble.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days! A\n" +
        "classmate accosted me one afternoon on Gurpar Road.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me\n" +
        "there in a decidedly awkward position. I unburdened myself under\n" +
        "his friendly gaze.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Nantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament\n" +
        "was not without a comic aspect.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to\n" +
        "me to help you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The simple words conveyed divine promise to my ears; with alacrity\n" +
        "I visited my friends home. He kindly outlined the solutions to\n" +
        "various problems he considered likely to be set by the instructors.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys\n" +
        "in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape\n" +
        "without injury.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned\n" +
        "erudition, I devoutly prayed it would remain for the next few\n" +
        "critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but,\n" +
        "under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently\n" +
        "I reminded God of the oversight.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I set out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my new\n" +
        "knowledge to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I took a short\n" +
        "cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose\n" +
        "printed sheets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse.\n" +
        "I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His\n" +
        "rich voice filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the\n" +
        "ancient tongue. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "These exceptional stanzas cannot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit\n" +
        "test. The scholar dismissed them skeptically.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following\n" +
        "day to pass the Sanskrit examination. Through the discerning help\n" +
        "Nantu had given, I also attained the minimum grade for success in\n" +
        "all my other subjects.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father was pleased that I had kept my word and concluded my secondary\n" +
        "school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, whose sole guidance\n" +
        "I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route\n" +
        "of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression\n" +
        "to His timely design for my rescue.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I came across the discarded book whose author had denied God\n" +
        "precedence in the examination halls. I could not restrain a chuckle\n" +
        "at my own silent comment:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It would only add to this fellows confusion, if I were to tell\n" +

        "\n" +
        "In my new dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. Together\n" +
        "with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, I decided to join a\n" +
        "Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its spiritual discipline.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A desolation fell over me one morning at thought of separation from\n" +
        "my family. Since Mothers death, my affection had grown especially\n" +
        "tender for my two younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed\n" +
        "to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes\n" +
        "in my turbulent SADHANA. After a two-hour flood of tears,\n" +
        "I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All\n" +
        "attachment disappeared; my resolution to seek God as the\n" +
        "Friend of friends set like granite within me. I quickly completed\n" +
        "my travel preparations.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I make one last plea. Father was distressed as I stood before him\n" +
        "for final blessing. Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers\n" +
        "and sisters.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Revered Father, how can I tell my love for you! But even greater\n" +
        "is my love for the Heavenly Father, who has given me the gift of\n" +
        "a perfect father on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with\n" +
        "a more divine understanding.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With reluctant parental consent, I set out to join Jitendra, already\n" +
        "in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young head swami,\n" +
        "Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien,\n" +
        "he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed\n" +
        "to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing\n" +
        "little of meditation practices, thought I should employ my whole\n" +
        "time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon\n" +
        "work in their office.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dont try to catch God so soon! This ridicule from a fellow\n" +
        "resident accompanied one of my early departures toward the attic. I\n" +
        "went to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swamiji, I dont understand what is required of me here.\n" +
        "I am seeking direct perception of God. Without Him, I cannot be\n" +
        "satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of good works.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging\n" +
        "a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disciples. Dont bother\n" +
        "Mukunda. He will learn our ways.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I politely concealed my doubt. The students left the room, not overly\n" +
        "bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further words for me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, I see your father is regularly sending you money. Please\n" +
        "return it to him; you require none here. A second injunction for\n" +
        "your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, dont\n" +
        "mention it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Whether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry,\n" +
        "I knew only too well. The invariable hour for the first hermitage\n" +
        "meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a\n" +
        "large breakfast at nine oclock.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the\n" +
        "Calcutta years when I could rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay.\n" +
        "Now I tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty-four\n" +
        "hour fast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dyanandajis train is late; we are not going to eat until he\n" +
        "arrives. Jitendra brought me this devastating news. As gesture\n" +
        "of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for two weeks, many\n" +
        "delicacies were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air.\n" +
        "Nothing else offering, what else could be swallowed except pride\n" +
        "over yesterdays achievement of a fast?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lord hasten the train! The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly\n" +
        "included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me.\n" +
        "Divine Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered\n" +
        "the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door.\n" +
        "My greeting was one of unfeigned joy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food.\n" +
        "Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation,\n" +
        "protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims\n" +
        "passed wraithlike before me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this\n" +
        "hermitage, I thought. Impending doom averted at nine oclock.\n" +
        "Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of lifes\n" +
        "perfect hours.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Intense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate\n" +
        "absent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swamiji, werent you hungry? Happily surfeited, I was alone with\n" +
        "the leader in his study.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O yes! I have spent the last four days without food or drink.\n" +
        "I never eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of\n" +
        "worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC rules for\n" +
        "monks of my particular order.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind.\n" +
        "Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. Whats the hurry? Tomorrow\n" +
        "Ill make it a point to have a proper meal. He laughed merrily.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Shame spread within me like a suffocation. But the past day of my\n" +
        "torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never\n" +
        "asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Die then! This alarming counsel split the air. Die if you must\n" +
        "Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the power of food and not by\n" +
        "the power of God! He who has created every form of nourishment, He\n" +
        "who has bestowed appetite, will certainly see that His devotee is\n" +
        "sustained! Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money\n" +
        "or men support you! Could they aid if the Lord withdraws your\n" +
        "life-breath? They are His indirect instruments merely. Is it by\n" +
        "any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword\n" +
        "of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency\n" +
        "and perceive the Single Cause!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I found his incisive words entering some deep marrow. Gone was\n" +
        "an age-old delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul.\n" +
        "There and then I tasted the Spirits all-sufficiency. In how many\n" +
        "strange cities, in my later life of ceaseless travel, did occasion\n" +
        "arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares\n" +

        "\n" +
        "The sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the\n" +
        "SADHUS silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for\n" +
        "years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew\n" +
        "my joy in the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked\n" +
        "box. The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone.\n" +
        "Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It\n" +

        "home and all worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on\n" +
        "all sides.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Torn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved\n" +
        "to pray until answer was vouchsafed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions,\n" +

        "\n" +
        "The passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly\n" +
        "I felt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thy Master cometh today! A divine womanly voice came from everywhere\n" +
        "and nowhere.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite\n" +
        "locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the\n" +
        "downstairs kitchen.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Another day I might have replied impatiently; now I wiped\n" +
        "my tear-swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. Together Habu\n" +
        "and I set out for a distant market place in the Bengali section of\n" +
        "Benares. The ungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made\n" +
        "our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our way through the colorful\n" +
        "medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified\n" +
        "Brahmins, and the ubiquitous holy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous\n" +
        "lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at\n" +
        "the end of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed;\n" +
        "my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,\n" +
        "I thought. Dreamer, walk on.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though\n" +
        "turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously\n" +
        "I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite\n" +
        "direction; again the curious weight oppressed me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint is magnetically drawing me to him! With this thought,\n" +
        "I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing\n" +
        "my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What ails you? Are you crazy?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Retracing my steps as though wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane.\n" +
        "My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my\n" +
        "direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Gurudeva! The divine face was none other than he of my\n" +
        "thousand visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed\n" +
        "beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal\n" +
        "reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O my own, you have come to me! My guru uttered the words again\n" +
        "and again in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. How many years\n" +
        "I have waited for you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest\n" +
        "superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of\n" +
        "master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed\n" +
        "that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration\n" +
        "of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories.\n" +
        "Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes.\n" +
        "This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My hand in his, my guru led me to his temporary residence in the\n" +
        "Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm\n" +
        "tread. Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active\n" +
        "and vigorous as a young man. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with\n" +
        "plumbless wisdom. Slightly curly hair softened a face of striking\n" +
        "power. Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As we made our way to the stone balcony of a house overlooking the\n" +
        "Ganges, he said affectionately:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will give you my hermitages and all I possess.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I come for wisdom and God-contact. Those are your treasure-troves\n" +
        "I am after!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my\n" +
        "master spoke again. His eyes held unfathomable tenderness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I give you my unconditional love.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had another\n" +
        "auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ardor; silence\n" +
        "became his oceanic heart.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Will you give me the same unconditional love? He gazed at me with\n" +
        "childlike trust.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.\n" +
        "Divine love is without condition, without boundary, without change.\n" +
        "The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch\n" +
        "of pure love. He added humbly, If ever you find me falling from\n" +
        "a state of God-realization, please promise to put my head on your\n" +
        "lap and help to bring me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner\n" +
        "room. As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively\n" +
        "wove into his conversation an intimate knowledge of my nature. I\n" +
        "was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended\n" +
        "with an innate humility.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do not grieve for your amulet. It has served its purpose. Like\n" +
        "a divine mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my\n" +
        "whole life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any\n" +
        "symbol.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is time for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated\n" +
        "in the hermitage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I had made no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous!\n" +
        "By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understood that he wished no\n" +
        "astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your\n" +
        "love of humanity?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return,\n" +
        "though I had been unresponsive to many pleas by letter. Let the\n" +
        "young bird fly in the metaphysical skies, Ananta had remarked.\n" +
        "His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We shall yet see him\n" +
        "swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family\n" +
        "nest. This discouraging simile fresh in my mind, I was determined\n" +
        "to do no swooping in the direction of Calcutta.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I am not returning home. But I will follow you anywhere.\n" +
        "Please give me your address, and your name.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. My chief hermitage is in Serampore, on\n" +
        "Rai Ghat Lane. I am visiting my mother here for only a few days.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I wondered at Gods intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is\n" +
        "but twelve miles from Calcutta, yet in those regions I had never\n" +
        "caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting\n" +
        "to the ancient city of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and\n" +
        "other Yogi--Christs had blessed the soil.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You will come to me in four weeks. For the first time, Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars voice was stern. Now I have told my eternal affection,\n" +
        "and have shown my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard\n" +
        "my request. The next time we meet, you will have to reawaken my\n" +
        "interest: I wont accept you as a disciple easily. There must be\n" +
        "complete surrender by obedience to my strict training.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my\n" +
        "difficulty.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will not return.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You will return in thirty days.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Never. Bowing reverently at his feet, I departed without lightening\n" +
        "the controversial tension. As I made my way in the midnight darkness,\n" +
        "I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious\n" +
        "note. The dual scales of MAYA, that balance every joy with a grief!\n" +
        "My young heart was not yet malleable to the transforming fingers\n" +
        "of my guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude\n" +
        "of the hermitage members. My days became spiked with invariable\n" +
        "rudeness. In three weeks, Dyananda left the ashram to attend a\n" +
        "conference in Bombay; pandemonium broke over my hapless head.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda is a parasite, accepting hermitage hospitality without\n" +
        "making proper return. Overhearing this remark, I regretted for the\n" +
        "first time that I had obeyed the request to send back my money to\n" +
        "Father. With heavy heart, I sought out my sole friend, Jitendra.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am leaving. Please convey my respectful regrets to Dyanandaji\n" +
        "when he returns.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will leave also! My attempts to meditate here meet with no more\n" +
        "favor than your own. Jitendra spoke with determination.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have met a Christlike saint. Let us visit him in Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "And so the bird prepared to swoop perilously close to Calcutta!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It would serve you right if Father disinherited you, Mukunda! How\n" +
        "foolishly you are throwing away your life! An elder-brother sermon\n" +
        "was assaulting my ears.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jitendra and I, fresh from the train (a figure of speech merely;\n" +
        "we were covered with dust), had just arrived at the home of Ananta,\n" +
        "recently transferred from Calcutta to the ancient city of Agra.\n" +
        "Brother was a supervising accountant for the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You well know, Ananta, I seek my inheritance from the Heavenly\n" +
        "Father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Money first; God can come later! Who knows? Life may be too long.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "God first; money is His slave! Who can tell? Life may be too\n" +
        "short.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My retort was summoned by the exigencies of the moment, and held\n" +
        "no presentiment. Yet the leaves of time unfolded to early finality\n" +
        "for Ananta; a few years later he entered the land where\n" +
        "bank notes avail neither first nor last.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Wisdom from the hermitage, I suppose! But I see you have left\n" +
        "Benares. Anantas eyes gleamed with satisfaction; he yet hoped to\n" +
        "secure my pinions in the family nest.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My sojourn in Benares was not in vain! I found there everything my\n" +
        "heart had been longing for! You may be sure it was not your pundit\n" +
        "or his son!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ananta joined me in reminiscent laughter; he had had to admit that\n" +
        "the Benares clairvoyant he selected was a shortsighted one.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What are your plans, my wandering brother?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jitendra persuaded me to Agra. We shall view the beauties of the\n" +
        "Taj Mahal here, I explained. Then we are going to my\n" +
        "newly-found guru, who has a hermitage in Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ananta hospitably arranged for our comfort. Several times during\n" +
        "the evening I noticed his eyes fixed on me reflectively.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I know that look! I thought. A plot is brewing!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The denouement took place during our early breakfast.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So you feel quite independent of Fathers wealth. Anantas gaze\n" +
        "was innocent as he resumed the barbs of yesterdays conversation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am conscious of my dependence on God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Words are cheap! Life has shielded you thus far! What a plight\n" +
        "if you were forced to look to the Invisible Hand for your food and\n" +
        "shelter! You would soon be begging on the streets!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Never! I would not put faith in passers-by rather than God! He can\n" +
        "devise for His devotee a thousand resources besides the begging-bowl!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be\n" +
        "put to a test in this tangible world?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I would agree! Do you confine God to a speculative world?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We shall see; today you shall have opportunity either to enlarge\n" +
        "or to confirm my own views! Ananta paused for a dramatic moment;\n" +
        "then spoke slowly and seriously.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I propose that I send you and your fellow disciple Jitendra this\n" +
        "morning to the near-by city of Brindaban. You must not take a\n" +
        "single rupee; you must not beg, either for food or money; you must\n" +
        "not reveal your predicament to anyone; you must not go without your\n" +
        "meals; and you must not be stranded in Brindaban. If you return\n" +
        "to my bungalow here before twelve oclock tonight, without having\n" +
        "broken any rule of the test, I shall be the most astonished man in\n" +
        "Agra!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I accept the challenge. No hesitation was in my words or in\n" +
        "my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence:\n" +
        "my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Mahasayas\n" +
        "picture; the playful gift of the two kites on the Lahore roof with\n" +
        "Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive\n" +
        "message through the unknown Benares SADHU outside the compound of\n" +
        "the pundits home; the vision of Divine Mother and Her majestic\n" +
        "words of love; Her swift heed through Master Mahasaya to my trifling\n" +
        "embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my\n" +
        "high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living Master from\n" +
        "the mist of lifelong dreams. Never could I admit my philosophy\n" +
        "unequal to any tussle on the worlds harsh proving ground!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your willingness does you credit. Ill escort you to the train\n" +
        "at once. Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. You must go\n" +
        "along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way\n" +
        "tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner\n" +
        "of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly\n" +
        "satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple DHOTIS\n" +
        " concealed nothing more than was necessary.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke\n" +
        "protestingly. Ananta, give me one or two rupees as a safeguard.\n" +
        "Then I can telegraph you in case of misfortune.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jitendra! My ejaculation was sharply reproachful. I will not\n" +
        "proceed with the test if you take any money as final security.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There is something reassuring about the clink of coins. Jitendra\n" +
        "said no more as I regarded him sternly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, I am not heartless. A hint of humility had crept into\n" +
        "Anantas voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him;\n" +
        "perhaps for sending two insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps\n" +
        "for his own religious skepticism. If by any chance or grace you\n" +
        "pass successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to\n" +
        "initiate me as your disciple.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This promise had a certain irregularity, in keeping with the\n" +
        "unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family\n" +
        "seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience\n" +
        "second only to a father. But no time remained for my comment; our\n" +
        "train was at point of departure.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the\n" +
        "miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pinched me\n" +
        "painfully at an awkward spot.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see no sign that God is going to supply our next meal!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the Lord is working with us.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Can you also arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely\n" +
        "at the prospect before us. I left Benares to view the Tajs mausoleum,\n" +
        "not to enter my own!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have our first glimpse of the\n" +
        "sacred wonders of Brindaban? I am in deep joy at thought\n" +
        "of treading the ground hallowed by feet of Lord Krishna.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The door of our compartment opened; two men seated themselves. The\n" +
        "next train stop would be the last.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban? The stranger opposite\n" +
        "me was taking a surprising interest.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "None of your business! Rudely I averted my gaze.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment\n" +
        "of the Stealer of Hearts. I am of devotional temperament\n" +
        "myself. I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive\n" +
        "food, and shelter from this overpowering heat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in\n" +
        "judging us to be truants from home.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No further conversation ensued; the train came to a halt. As Jitendra\n" +
        "and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms\n" +
        "with us and summoned a horse cab.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We alit before a stately hermitage, set amidst the evergreen trees\n" +
        "of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently known here; a\n" +
        "smiling lad led us without comment to a parlor. We were soon joined\n" +
        "by an elderly woman of dignified bearing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Gauri Ma, the princes could not come. One of the men addressed\n" +
        "the ashram hostess. At the last moment their plans went awry; they\n" +
        "send deep regrets. But we have brought two other guests. As soon\n" +
        "as we met on the train, I felt drawn to them as devotees of Lord\n" +
        "Krishna.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Good-by, young friends. Our two acquaintances walked to the door.\n" +
        "We shall meet again, if God be willing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are welcome here. Gauri Ma smiled in motherly fashion on her\n" +
        "two unexpected charges. You could not have come on a better day.\n" +
        "I was expecting two royal patrons of this hermitage. What a shame\n" +
        "if my cooking had found none to appreciate it!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These appetizing words had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst\n" +
        "into tears. The prospect he had feared in Brindaban was turning\n" +
        "out as royal entertainment; his sudden mental adjustment proved\n" +
        "too much for him. Our hostess looked at him with curiosity, but\n" +
        "without remark; perhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the way to a dining patio, spicy\n" +
        "with savory odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate\n" +
        "spot on Jitendras anatomy, I administered a pinch as resounding\n" +
        "as the one he had given me on the train.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Doubting Thomas, the Lord works-in a hurry, too!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The hostess reentered with a PUNKHA. She steadily fanned us in the\n" +
        "Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanket-seats. Ashram\n" +
        "disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather than\n" +
        "meal, the description can only be sumptuous repast. Since\n" +
        "arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had never before tasted\n" +
        "such delicacies.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal\n" +
        "patrons could have found more urgent than attending this banquet,\n" +
        "I cannot imagine! You have given us a memory for a lifetime!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Silenced as we were by Anantas requirement, we could not explain\n" +
        "to the gracious lady that our thanks held a double significance.\n" +
        "Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing\n" +
        "and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I made for the\n" +
        "shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp words\n" +
        "followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A fine mess you have got me into! Our luncheon was only accidental\n" +
        "good fortune! How can we see the sights of this city, without a\n" +
        "single pice between us? And how on earth are you going to take me\n" +
        "back to Anantas?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You forget God quickly, now that your stomach is filled. My words,\n" +
        "not bitter, were accusatory. How short is human memory for divine\n" +
        "favors! No man lives who has not seen certain of his prayers granted.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap\n" +
        "like you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be quiet, Jitendra! The same Lord who fed us will show us Brindaban,\n" +
        "and return us to Agra.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A slight young man of pleasing countenance approached at rapid\n" +
        "pace. Halting under our tree, he bowed before me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dear friend, you and your companion must be strangers here. Permit\n" +
        "me to be your host and guide.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendras face\n" +
        "was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are surely not banishing me? The strangers alarm would have\n" +
        "been comic in any other circumstances.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why not?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are my guru. His eyes sought mine trustfully. During my\n" +
        "midday devotions, the blessed Lord Krishna appeared in a vision.\n" +
        "He showed me two forsaken figures under this very tree. One face\n" +
        "was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy\n" +
        "if you accept my humble services!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I too am glad you have found me. Neither God nor man has forsaken\n" +
        "us! Though I was motionless, smiling at the eager face before me,\n" +
        "an inward obeisance cast me at the Divine Feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests\n" +
        "of my brother in Agra.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap\n" +
        "Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple\n" +
        "and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our\n" +
        "temple devotions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Excuse me while I get SANDESH. Pratap entered a shop\n" +
        "near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the\n" +
        "wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend\n" +
        "was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many\n" +
        "sweetmeats.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please allow me to gain this religious merit. Pratap smiled\n" +
        "pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and two tickets,\n" +
        "just purchased, to Agra.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The reverence of my acceptance was for the Invisible Hand. Scoffed\n" +
        "at by Ananta, had Its bounty not far exceeded necessity?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We sought out a secluded spot near the station.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Pratap, I will instruct you in the KRIYA of Lahiri Mahasaya, the\n" +
        "greatest yogi of modern times. His technique will be your guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The initiation was concluded in a half hour. KRIYA is your CHINTAMANI,\n" +
        " I told the new student. The technique, which as you see\n" +
        "is simple, embodies the art of quickening mans spiritual evolution.\n" +
        "Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million\n" +
        "years to obtain liberation from MAYA. This natural period is\n" +
        "greatly shortened through KRIYA YOGA. Just as Jagadis Chandra Bose\n" +
        "has demonstrated that plant growth can be accelerated far beyond\n" +
        "its normal rate, so mans psychological development can be also\n" +
        "speeded by an inner science. Be faithful in your practice; you will\n" +
        "approach the Guru of all gurus.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am transported to find this yogic key, long sought! Pratap\n" +
        "spoke thoughtfully. Its unshackling effect on my sensory bonds\n" +
        "will free me for higher spheres. The vision today of Lord Krishna\n" +
        "could only mean my highest good.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We sat awhile in silent understanding, then walked slowly to the\n" +
        "station. Joy was within me as I boarded the train, but this was\n" +
        "Jitendras day for tears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had\n" +
        "been punctuated by stifled sobs from both my companions. The journey\n" +
        "once more found Jitendra in a welter of grief. Not for himself this\n" +
        "time, but against himself.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How shallow my trust! My heart has been stone! Never in future\n" +
        "shall I doubt Gods protection!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Midnight was approaching. The two Cinderellas, sent forth\n" +
        "penniless, entered Anantas bedroom. His face, as he had promised,\n" +
        "was a study in astonishment. Silently I showered the table with\n" +
        "rupees.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jitendra, the truth! Anantas tone was jocular. Has not this\n" +
        "youngster been staging a holdup?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But as the tale was unfolded, my brother turned sober, then solemn.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The law of demand and supply reaches into subtler realms than I\n" +
        "had supposed. Ananta spoke with a spiritual enthusiasm never before\n" +
        "noticeable. I understand for the first time your indifference to\n" +
        "the vaults and vulgar accumulations of the world.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Late as it was, my brother insisted that he receive DIKSHA \n" +
        "into KRIYA YOGA. The guru Mukunda had to shoulder the responsibility\n" +
        "of two unsought disciples in one day.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the\n" +
        "day before. I smiled at Jitendra.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You shall not be cheated of the Taj. Let us view it before starting\n" +
        "for Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bidding farewell to Ananta, my friend and I were soon before the\n" +
        "glory of Agra, the Taj Mahal. White marble dazzling in the sun,\n" +
        "it stands a vision of pure symmetry. The perfect setting is dark\n" +
        "cypress, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon. The interior is exquisite\n" +
        "with lacelike carvings inlaid with semiprecious stones. Delicate\n" +
        "wreaths and scrolls emerge intricately from marbles, brown and\n" +
        "violet. Illumination from the dome falls on the cenotaphs of Emperor\n" +
        "Shah-Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall, queen of his realm and his heart.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Enough of sight-seeing! I was longing for my guru. Jitendra and I\n" +
        "were shortly traveling south by train toward Bengal.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, I have not seen my family in months. I have changed my\n" +
        "mind; perhaps later I shall visit your master in Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My friend, who may mildly be described as vacillating in temperament,\n" +
        "left me in Calcutta. By local train I soon reached Serampore, twelve\n" +
        "miles to the north.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A throb of wonderment stole over me as I realized that twenty-eight\n" +
        "days had elapsed since the Benares meeting with my guru. You will\n" +
        "come to me in four weeks! Here I was, heart pounding, standing\n" +
        "within his courtyard on quiet Rai Ghat Lane. I entered for the first\n" +
        "time the hermitage where I was to spend the best part of the next\n" +
        "ten years with Indias JYANAVATAR, incarnation of wisdom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You have come. Sri Yukteswar greeted me from a tiger skin on the\n" +
        "floor of a balconied sitting room. His voice was cold, his manner\n" +
        "unemotional.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, dear Master, I am here to follow you. Kneeling, I touched\n" +
        "his feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How can that be? You ignore my wishes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No longer, Guruji! Your wish shall be my law!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That is better! Now I can assume responsibility for your life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I willingly transfer the burden, Master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My first request, then, is that you return home to your family.\n" +
        "I want you to enter college in Calcutta. Your education should be\n" +
        "continued.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Very well, sir. I hid my consternation. Would importunate books\n" +
        "pursue me down the years? First Father, now Sri Yukteswar!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Someday you will go to the West. Its people will lend ears more\n" +
        "receptive to Indias ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher\n" +
        "has a university degree.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You know best, Guruji. My gloom departed. The reference to the\n" +
        "West I found puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please Master\n" +
        "by obedience was vitally immediate.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You will be near in Calcutta; come here whenever you find time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Every day if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority\n" +
        "in every detail of my life-on one condition.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That you promise to reveal God to me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A masters word cannot be\n" +
        "falsified; it is not lightly given. The implications in the pledge\n" +
        "open out vast metaphysical vistas. A guru must be on intimate\n" +
        "terms indeed with the Creator before he can obligate Him to appear!\n" +
        "I sensed Sri Yukteswars divine unity, and was determined, as his\n" +
        "disciple, to press my advantage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are of exacting disposition! Then Masters consent rang out\n" +
        "with compassionate finality:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let your wish be my wish.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lifelong shadow lifted from my heart; the vague search, hither and\n" +
        "yon, was over. I had found eternal shelter in a true guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come; I will show you the hermitage. Master rose from his tiger\n" +
        "mat. I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall\n" +
        "picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, my divine guru. Sri Yukteswars tone was reverently vibrant.\n" +
        "Greater he was, as man and yogi, than any other teacher whose life\n" +
        "came within the range of my investigations.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Silently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul-homage sped to\n" +
        "the peerless master who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps\n" +
        "to this hour.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Led by my guru, I strolled over the house and its grounds.\n" +
        "Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a\n" +
        "massive-pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons\n" +
        "fluttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the\n" +
        "ashram quarters. A rear garden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango,\n" +
        "and plantain trees. Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the\n" +
        "two-storied building faced the courtyard from three sides. A spacious\n" +
        "ground-floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was\n" +
        "used, Master said, chiefly during the annual festivities of DURGAPUJA.\n" +
        " A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswars sitting room,\n" +
        "whose small balcony overlooked the street. The ashram was plainly\n" +
        "furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several\n" +
        "Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was\n" +
        "served by two young disciples who were receiving hermitage training.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, please tell me something of your life. I was squatting\n" +
        "on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very\n" +
        "close, it seemed, beyond the balcony.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was born here\n" +
        "in Serampore, where Father was a wealthy businessman. He left me\n" +
        "this ancestral mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was\n" +
        "little; I found it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook\n" +
        "the responsibilities of a householder, and have one daughter, now\n" +
        "married. My middle life was blessed with the guidance of Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya. After my wife died, I joined the Swami Order and received\n" +
        "the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. Such are my simple\n" +
        "annals.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches,\n" +
        "his words had given the outward facts without revealing the inner\n" +
        "man.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, I would like to hear some stories of your childhood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will tell you a few-each one with a moral! Sri Yukteswars\n" +
        "eyes twinkled with his warning. My mother once tried to frighten\n" +
        "me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I went\n" +
        "there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed\n" +
        "the ghost. Mother never told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look\n" +
        "fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to\n" +
        "a neighbor. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that\n" +
        "dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing\n" +
        "appearance. Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary\n" +
        "halo of attractiveness to the object of desire.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I\n" +
        "heard my mother remark occasionally: A man who accepts a job under\n" +
        "anyone is a slave. That impression became so indelibly fixed that\n" +
        "even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by\n" +
        "investing my family endowment in land. Moral: Good and positive\n" +
        "suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their\n" +
        "early ideas long remain sharply etched.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to\n" +
        "a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my\n" +
        "gurus roof.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his KRIYA YOGA\n" +
        "initiation. The technique I had already received from two disciples\n" +
        "of Lahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in\n" +
        "Masters presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great\n" +
        "light broke upon my being, like glory of countless suns blazing\n" +
        "together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an\n" +
        "innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late\n" +
        "that afternoon before I could bring myself to leave the hermitage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You will return in thirty days. As I reached my Calcutta home,\n" +
        "the fulfillment of Masters prediction entered with me. None of my\n" +
        "relatives made the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance\n" +
        "of the soaring bird.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances,\n" +
        "as though on a living presence. You have witnessed my meditations,\n" +
        "and the tears and storms of my SADHANA. Now I have reached the\n" +
        "harbor of my divine teacher.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, I am happy for us both. Father and I sat together in the\n" +
        "evening calm. You have found your guru, as in miraculous fashion\n" +
        "I once found my own. The holy hand of Lahiri Mahasaya is guarding\n" +
        "our lives. Your master has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint,\n" +
        "but one near-by. My prayers have been answered: you have not in\n" +
        "your search for God been permanently removed from my sight.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father was also pleased that my formal studies would be resumed;\n" +
        "he made suitable arrangements. I was enrolled the following day at\n" +
        "the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Happy months sped by. My readers have doubtless made the perspicacious\n" +
        "surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The\n" +
        "Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master accepted\n" +
        "my ubiquitous presence without comment. To my relief, he seldom\n" +
        "referred to the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all that\n" +
        "I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum\n" +
        "passing grades from time to time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Daily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My\n" +
        "guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed,\n" +
        "he entered a state of SAMADHI. It was simplicity itself\n" +
        "to discover when Master had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous\n" +
        "snores. A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a\n" +
        "soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Breakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges.\n" +
        "Those morning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In\n" +
        "the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side:\n" +
        "the early sun is warming the river. His voice rings out, rich with\n" +
        "the authenticity of wisdom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Masters\n" +
        "daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My\n" +
        "guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had\n" +
        "eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple\n" +
        "diet which proved suited to ones constitution.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of\n" +
        "beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo GHEE or melted\n" +
        "butter. Another day he might have lentil-DHAL or CHANNA \n" +
        "curry with vegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice\n" +
        "pudding, or jackfruit juice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Visitors appeared in the afternoons. A steady stream poured from\n" +
        "the world into the hermitage tranquillity. Everyone found in Master\n" +
        "an equal courtesy and kindness. To a man who has realized himself\n" +
        "as a soul, not the body or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes\n" +
        "a striking similarity of aspect.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped\n" +
        "MAYA; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast\n" +
        "an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration\n" +
        "to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did\n" +
        "he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen\n" +
        "respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a\n" +
        "conceited pundit.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Eight oclock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering\n" +
        "guests. My guru would not excuse himself to eat alone; none left his\n" +
        "ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss,\n" +
        "never dismayed by unexpected visitors; scanty food would emerge\n" +
        "a banquet under his resourceful direction. Yet he was economical;\n" +
        "his modest funds went far. Be comfortable within your purse,\n" +
        "he often said. Extravagance will buy you discomfort. Whether in\n" +
        "the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair\n" +
        "work, or other practical concerns, Master manifested the originality\n" +
        "of a creative spirit.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Quiet evening hours often brought one of my gurus discourses,\n" +
        "treasures against time. His every utterance was measured and chiseled\n" +
        "by wisdom. A sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression:\n" +
        "it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke.\n" +
        "His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination\n" +
        "before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth,\n" +
        "all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like\n" +
        "a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I\n" +
        "was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight\n" +
        "of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed\n" +
        "with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was\n" +
        "incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal.\n" +
        "Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate time for communion.\n" +
        "A self-realized master has already left behind the stepping stone\n" +
        "of meditation. The flower falls when the fruit appears. But saints\n" +
        "often cling to spiritual forms for the encouragement of disciples.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the\n" +
        "naturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often\n" +
        "lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was\n" +
        "the background for his customary tiger-skin seat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple\n" +
        "could summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then,\n" +
        "no desire for sleep; Masters living words were sufficient. Oh,\n" +
        "it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges. So ended many of my periods\n" +
        "of nocturnal edification.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-How\n" +
        "to Outwit a Mosquito. At home my family always used protective\n" +
        "curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore\n" +
        "hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the\n" +
        "insects were in full residency; I was bitten from head to foot. My\n" +
        "guru took pity on me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me. He laughed and added,\n" +
        "If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate\n" +
        "on me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in\n" +
        "Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But Master\n" +
        "failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to\n" +
        "the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a\n" +
        "propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later,\n" +
        "I coughed pretentiously to attract my gurus attention. I thought\n" +
        "I would go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as\n" +
        "the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was\n" +
        "not breathing. This was my first observation of him in the yogic\n" +
        "trance; it filled me with fright.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His heart must have failed! I placed a mirror under his nose;\n" +
        "no breath-vapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I\n" +
        "closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold\n" +
        "and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose! Masters voice was\n" +
        "shaky with laughter. Why dont you go to bed? Is the whole world\n" +
        "going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito\n" +
        "consciousness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Meekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized\n" +
        "that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please\n" +
        "me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that\n" +
        "he either could will them not to bite, or could escape to an inner\n" +
        "invulnerability.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He was giving me a demonstration, I thought. That is the yogic\n" +
        "state I must strive to attain. A yogi must be able to pass into,\n" +
        "and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous\n" +
        "distractions never absent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of\n" +
        "insects or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the\n" +
        "senses must be barred. Sound and sight come then indeed, but to\n" +
        "worlds fairer than the banished Eden. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the\n" +
        "ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly\n" +
        "interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace.\n" +
        "A rude mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As\n" +
        "it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically\n" +
        "raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An\n" +
        "opportune memory came to me of one of Patanjalis yoga aphorisms-that\n" +
        "on AHIMSA (harmlessness).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why didnt you finish the job?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master! Do you advocate taking life?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I dont understand.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Patanjalis meaning was the removal of DESIRE to kill. Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book. This world\n" +
        "is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of AHIMSA. Man\n" +
        "may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under\n" +
        "similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of life\n" +
        "have equal right to the air of MAYA. The saint who uncovers the\n" +
        "secret of creation will be in harmony with its countless bewildering\n" +
        "expressions. All men may approach that understanding who curb the\n" +
        "inner passion for destruction.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a\n" +
        "wild beast?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No; mans body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary\n" +
        "value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the\n" +
        "advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects\n" +
        "of divinity. No lower form is so equipped. It is true that one\n" +
        "incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or\n" +
        "any living thing. But the VEDAS teach that wanton loss of a human\n" +
        "body is a serious transgression against the karmic law.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of ones natural\n" +
        "instincts is not always forthcoming.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It so happened that I never saw Master at close quarters with a\n" +
        "leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only\n" +
        "to be conquered by my gurus love. This variety of snake is much\n" +
        "feared in India, where it causes more than five thousand deaths\n" +
        "annually. The dangerous encounter took place at Puri, where Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar had a second hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay\n" +
        "of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with\n" +
        "Master on this occasion.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We were seated outdoors near the ashram, Prafulla told me. A\n" +
        "cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror. Its\n" +
        "hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a\n" +
        "welcoming chuckle, as though to a child. I was beside myself with\n" +
        "consternation to see Master engage in a rhythmical clapping of\n" +
        "hands. He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained\n" +
        "absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating what fervent prayers I could\n" +
        "muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless,\n" +
        "seemingly magnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood\n" +
        "gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Masters feet\n" +
        "and disappeared into the bushes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why my guru would move his hands, and why the cobra would not\n" +
        "strike them, were inexplicable to me then, Prafulla concluded. I\n" +
        "have since come to realize that my divine master is beyond fear of\n" +
        "hurt from any living creature.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One afternoon during my early months at the ashram, found Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars eyes fixed on me piercingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are too thin, Mukunda.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken eyes and\n" +
        "emaciated appearance were far from my liking was testified to by\n" +
        "rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic\n" +
        "dyspepsia had pursued me since childhood. My despair reached an\n" +
        "occasional zenith when I asked myself if it were worth-while to\n" +
        "carry on this life with a body so unsound.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none.\n" +
        "Believe that: you shall be well and strong.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars words aroused a conviction of personally-applicable\n" +
        "truth which no other healer-and I had tried many!-had been able to\n" +
        "summon within me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Day by day, behold! I waxed. Two weeks after Masters hidden\n" +
        "blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating weight which eluded\n" +
        "me in the past. My persistent stomach ailments vanished with\n" +
        "a lifelong permanency. On later occasions I witnessed my gurus\n" +
        "instantaneous divine healings of persons suffering from ominous\n" +
        "disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or paralysis. Not one\n" +
        "could have been more grateful for his cure than I was at sudden\n" +
        "freedom from my cadaverous aspect.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight, Sri Yukteswar told\n" +
        "me. During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya in Benares.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see, Yukteswar, you made yourself unwell, and now you\n" +
        "think you are thin.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however,\n" +
        "added encouragingly:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Taking his words as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive\n" +
        "mind, I was not surprised the next morning at a welcome accession\n" +
        "of strength. I sought out my master and exclaimed exultingly, Sir,\n" +
        "I feel much better today.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, master! I protested. It was you who helped me; this is the\n" +
        "first time in weeks that I have had any energy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O yes! Your malady has been quite serious. Your body is frail\n" +
        "yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The thought of possible return of my weakness brought me a shudder\n" +
        "of cold fear. The following morning I could hardly drag myself to\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasayas home.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I am ailing again.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My gurus glance was quizzical. So! Once more you indispose\n" +
        "yourself.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Gurudeva, I realize now that day by day you have been ridiculing\n" +
        "me. My patience was exhausted. I dont understand why you disbelieve\n" +
        "my truthful reports.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel\n" +
        "alternately weak and strong. My master looked at me affectionately.\n" +
        "You have seen how your health has exactly followed your expectations.\n" +
        "Thought is a force, even as electricity or gravitation. The human\n" +
        "mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I could show\n" +
        "you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely would\n" +
        "instantly come to pass.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya never spoke idly, I addressed him\n" +
        "with great awe and gratitude: Master, if I think I am well and\n" +
        "have regained my former weight, shall that happen?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is so, even at this moment. My guru spoke gravely, his gaze\n" +
        "concentrated on my eyes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lo! I felt an increase not alone of strength but of weight. Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I\n" +
        "returned to my mothers home, where I stayed during my visits to\n" +
        "Benares.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy? Mother\n" +
        "could hardly believe her eyes. My body was now of the same robust\n" +
        "dimensions it had possessed before my illness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I weighed myself and found that in one day I had gained fifty\n" +
        "pounds; they remained with me permanently. Friends and acquaintances\n" +
        "who had seen my thin figure were aghast with wonderment. A number\n" +
        "of them changed their mode of life and became disciples of Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya as a result of this miracle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru, awake in God, knew this world to be nothing but an objectivized\n" +
        "dream of the Creator. Because he was completely aware of his unity\n" +
        "with the Divine Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materialize or\n" +
        "dematerialize or make any change he wished in the cosmic vision.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All creation is governed by law, Sri Yukteswar concluded. The ones\n" +
        "which manifest in the outer universe, discoverable by scientists,\n" +
        "are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the\n" +
        "realms of consciousness which can be known only through the inner\n" +
        "science of yoga. The hidden spiritual planes also have their\n" +
        "natural and lawful principles of operation. It is not the physical\n" +
        "scientist but the fully self-realized master who comprehends the\n" +
        "true nature of matter. Thus Christ was able to restore the servants\n" +
        "ear after it had been severed by one of the disciples. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. Many of\n" +
        "my happiest memories are centered in his discourses. But his jeweled\n" +
        "thoughts were not cast into ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One\n" +
        "restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent-mindedness,\n" +
        "sufficed to put an abrupt period to Masters exposition.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are not here. Master interrupted himself one afternoon with\n" +
        "this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping track of my attention\n" +
        "with a devastating immediacy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji! My tone was a protest. I have not stirred; my eyelids\n" +
        "have not moved; I can repeat each word you have uttered!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me\n" +
        "to remark that in your mental background you were creating three\n" +
        "institutions. One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a\n" +
        "hilltop, a third by the ocean.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Those vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost\n" +
        "subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What can I do with such a master, who penetrates my random musings?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +

        "necessary I do not invade the seclusion of others minds. Man has\n" +
        "the natural privilege of roaming secretly among his thoughts. The\n" +

        "Thus incidentally my guru revealed in his simple way the coming of\n" +
        "three great events in my life. Since early youth I had had enigmatic\n" +
        "glimpses of three buildings, each in a different setting. In the\n" +
        "exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions took\n" +
        "ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys yoga school on a\n" +
        "Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop,\n" +
        "finally a hermitage in southern California by the vast Pacific.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master never arrogantly asserted: I prophesy that such and such\n" +
        "an event shall occur! He would rather hint: Dont you think it\n" +
        "may happen? But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no\n" +
        "recanting; never did his slightly veiled words prove false.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There\n" +
        "was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet\n" +
        "were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical\n" +
        "people aroused his admiration. Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine\n" +
        "perceptions are not incapacitating! he would say. The active\n" +
        "expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In Masters life I fully discovered the cleavage between spiritual\n" +
        "realism and the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as\n" +
        "a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical\n" +
        "realms. His only marvelous aura was one of perfect simplicity.\n" +
        "In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was\n" +
        "freely expressive. Others talked of miracles but could manifest\n" +
        "nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly\n" +
        "operated them at will.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he\n" +
        "receives an inward sanction, Master explained. God does not wish\n" +
        "the secrets of His creation revealed promiscuously. Also,\n" +
        "every individual in the world has inalienable right to his free\n" +
        "will. A saint will not encroach upon that independence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep\n" +
        "perceptions of the Infinite. No time remained for the interminable\n" +
        "revelations that occupy the days of teachers without self-realization.\n" +
        "In shallow men the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion.\n" +
        "In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle.\n" +
        "This observation from the Hindu scriptures is not without discerning\n" +
        "humor.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Because of my gurus unspectacular guise, only a few of his\n" +
        "contemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popular adage: He\n" +
        "is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom, could never be applied\n" +
        "to Sri Yukteswar. Though born a mortal like all others, Master had\n" +
        "achieved identity with the Ruler of time and space. In his life I\n" +
        "perceived a godlike unity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle\n" +
        "to mergence of human with Divine. No such barrier exists, I came\n" +

        "undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the\n" +
        "groove of his worldly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily\n" +
        "at least he may find the secret veils of MAYA lifting, and glimpse\n" +
        "the reality of bliss. My whole body responded with a liberating\n" +
        "glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent, Master told me, or when\n" +
        "he conversed on other than strictly religious topics, I discovered\n" +
        "that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in\n" +
        "a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly\n" +
        "changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Every\n" +
        "day with him was a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never\n" +
        "did I find him deluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or\n" +
        "anger or any human attachment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The darkness of MAYA is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward\n" +
        "within. With these words at dusk Master constantly reminded his\n" +
        "disciples of their need for KRIYA YOGA. A new student occasionally\n" +
        "expressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga\n" +
        "practice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Forget the past, Sri Yukteswar would console him. The vanished\n" +
        "lives of all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever\n" +
        "unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will\n" +
        "improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master always had young CHELAS in his hermitage. Their\n" +
        "spiritual and intellectual education was his lifelong interest:\n" +
        "even shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training two\n" +
        "six-year-old boys and one youth of sixteen. He directed their minds\n" +
        "and lives with that careful discipline in which the word disciple\n" +
        "is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered\n" +
        "their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed to bring them\n" +
        "eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one\n" +
        "ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, children looked\n" +
        "upon him as their own.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would\n" +
        "he accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere.\n" +
        "My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that\n" +
        "privileged task. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored\n" +
        "swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom,\n" +
        "were of tiger or deer skin.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his\n" +
        "Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by\n" +
        "certain short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study\n" +
        "of English and Sanskrit.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous\n" +
        "attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out, properly manifests through\n" +
        "physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A\n" +
        "disciple once started a long fast. My guru only laughed: Why not\n" +
        "throw the dog a bone?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars health was excellent; I never saw him unwell.\n" +
        " He permitted students to consult doctors if it seemed\n" +
        "advisable. His purpose was to give respect to the worldly custom:\n" +
        "Physicians must carry on their work of healing through Gods laws\n" +
        "as applied to matter. But he extolled the superiority of mental\n" +
        "therapy, and often repeated: Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more,\n" +
        "he said. Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities\n" +
        "with calmness, while trying at the same time to remove their hold.\n" +
        "Imagination is the door through which disease as well as healing\n" +
        "enters. Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are\n" +
        "ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master numbered many doctors among his disciples. Those who have\n" +
        "ferreted out the physical laws can easily investigate the science\n" +
        "of the soul, he told them. A subtle spiritual mechanism is hidden\n" +
        "just behind the bodily structure. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of\n" +
        "Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in\n" +
        "outer habits, inwardly he was the spiritual Oriental. He praised\n" +
        "the progressive, resourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and\n" +
        "the religious ideals which give a centuried halo to the East.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Discipline had not been unknown to me: at home Father was strict,\n" +
        "Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswars training cannot be described\n" +
        "as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical\n" +
        "of his disciples, whether in matters of moment or in the subtle\n" +
        "nuances of behavior.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,\n" +
        "he remarked on suitable occasion. Straightforwardness without\n" +
        "civility is like a surgeons knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor\n" +
        "with courtesy is helpful and admirable.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he\n" +
        "seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers\n" +
        "to reproof. My chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent\n" +
        "indulgence in sad moods, non-observance of certain rules of etiquette,\n" +
        "and occasional unmethodical ways.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well-organized\n" +
        "and balanced in every way, my guru pointed out. The two disciples\n" +
        "of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages\n" +
        "to Serampore. Father and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the\n" +
        "others worth. Both had built an inner life of spiritual granite,\n" +
        "insoluble against the ages.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "From transient teachers of my earlier life I had imbibed a few\n" +
        "erroneous lessons. A CHELA, I was told, need not concern himself\n" +
        "strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly\n" +
        "performed my tasks, I was not chastised. Human nature finds such\n" +
        "instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Masters unsparing\n" +
        "rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of\n" +
        "irresponsibility.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar remarked. So long as you breathe the free air of\n" +
        "earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone\n" +
        "who has fully mastered the breathless state is freed from\n" +
        "cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to let you know when you have\n" +
        "attained the final perfection.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru could never be bribed, even by love. He showed no leniency\n" +
        "to anyone who, like myself, willingly offered to be his disciple.\n" +
        "Whether Master and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers,\n" +
        "or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided\n" +
        "sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped\n" +
        "his rebuke. This flattening treatment was hard to endure, but my\n" +
        "resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological\n" +
        "kinks. As he labored at this titanic transformation, I shook many\n" +
        "times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If you dont like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any\n" +
        "time, Master assured me. I want nothing from you but your own\n" +
        "improvement. Stay only if you feel benefited.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "For every humbling blow he dealt my vanity, for every tooth in my\n" +
        "metaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful\n" +
        "beyond any facility of expression. The hard core of human egotism\n" +
        "is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the\n" +
        "Divine finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to\n" +
        "percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks,\n" +
        "he often replied to ones unspoken observation. What a person\n" +
        "imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may\n" +
        "be poles apart, he said. Try to feel the thoughts behind the\n" +
        "confusion of mens verbiage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular\n" +
        "with superficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply\n" +
        "revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most\n" +
        "soughtafter guru in India had his words not been so candid and so\n" +
        "censorious.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am hard on those who come for my training, he admitted to me.\n" +
        "That is my way; take it or leave it. I will never compromise. But\n" +
        "you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try\n" +
        "to purify only in the fires of severity, searing beyond the average\n" +
        "toleration. The gentle approach of love is also transfiguring. The\n" +
        "inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied\n" +
        "with wisdom. You will go to foreign lands, where blunt assaults\n" +
        "on the ego are not appreciated. A teacher could not spread Indias\n" +
        "message in the West without an ample fund of accommodative patience\n" +
        "and forbearance. I refuse to state the amount of truth I later\n" +
        "came to find in Masters words!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Though Sri Yukteswars undissembling speech prevented a large\n" +
        "following during his years on earth, nevertheless his living spirit\n" +
        "manifests today over the world, through sincere students of his\n" +
        "KRIYA YOGA and other teachings. He has further dominion in mens\n" +
        "souls than ever Alexander dreamed of in the soil.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father arrived one day to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My\n" +
        "parent expected, very likely, to hear some words in my praise. He\n" +
        "was shocked to be given a long account of my imperfections. It was\n" +
        "Masters practice to recount simple, negligible shortcomings with\n" +
        "an air of portentous gravity. Father rushed to see me. From your\n" +
        "gurus remarks I thought to find you a complete wreck! My parent\n" +
        "was between tears and laughter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The only cause of Sri Yukteswars displeasure at the time was that\n" +

        "man to the spiritual path.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with\n" +
        "downcast eyes, as though conscious of guilt. It was the only time\n" +
        "I ever saw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was\n" +
        "savored to the full.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded\n" +
        "father? Was that just?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will not do it again. Masters tone was apologetic.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Instantly I was disarmed. How readily the great man admitted his\n" +
        "fault! Though he never again upset Fathers peace of mind, Master\n" +
        "relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "New disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism\n" +
        "of others. Wise like the guru! Models of flawless discrimination!\n" +
        "But he who takes the offensive must not be defenseless. The same\n" +
        "carping students fled precipitantly as soon as Master publicly\n" +
        "unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure,\n" +
        "are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling before even delicate\n" +
        "handling. This was Sri Yukteswars amused comment on the flighty\n" +
        "ones.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There are disciples who seek a guru made in their own image. Such\n" +
        "students often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Neither do you comprehend God! I retorted on one occasion. When\n" +
        "a saint is clear to you, you will be one. Among the trillion\n" +
        "mysteries, breathing every second the inexplicable air, who may\n" +
        "venture to ask that the fathomless nature of a master be instantly\n" +
        "grasped?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Students came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of\n" +
        "oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions did not find it at the\n" +
        "hermitage. Master offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons,\n" +
        "but many disciples miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed,\n" +
        "preferring lifes countless humiliations before any humility.\n" +
        "Masters blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom,\n" +
        "were too powerful for their spiritual sickness. They sought some\n" +
        "lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful\n" +
        "sleep of ignorance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "During my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive\n" +
        "fear of his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples\n" +
        "who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student\n" +
        "made a protest, Sri Yukteswar would become unoffendedly silent.\n" +
        "His words were never wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Masters insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he\n" +
        "seldom remarked on their defects, even if conspicuous. But toward\n" +
        "students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious\n" +
        "responsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform\n" +
        "the crude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saints courage roots\n" +
        "in his compassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease\n" +
        "in my chastisement. In a very subtle way, Master melted into\n" +
        "comparative clemency. In time I demolished every wall of rationalization\n" +
        "and subconscious reservation behind which the human personality\n" +
        "generally shields itself. The reward was an effortless\n" +
        "harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate,\n" +
        "and silently loving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no word\n" +
        "of affection.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting\n" +
        "at first to find that my guru, saturated with JNANA but seemingly\n" +
        "dry of BHAKTI, expressed himself only in terms of\n" +
        "cold spiritual mathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature,\n" +
        "I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my devotional\n" +
        "approach to God. A self-realized master is fully able to guide his\n" +

        "\n" +
        "My relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless\n" +
        "possessed all eloquence. Often I found his silent signature on my\n" +
        "thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I\n" +
        "felt his bounty pouring peacefully over my being.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars impartial justice was notably demonstrated during\n" +

        "Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties. Employ your own time in\n" +
        "sweeping and cooking. Master issued these instructions after the\n" +
        "new boy had been with us for a month.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny.\n" +
        "In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for\n" +
        "daily counsel.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda is impossible! You made me supervisor, yet the others go\n" +
        "to him and obey him. Three weeks later Kumar was complaining to\n" +
        "our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thats why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor.\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars withering tones were new to Kumar. In this way you\n" +
        "have come to realize that a worthy leader has the desire to serve,\n" +
        "and not to dominate. You wanted Mukundas position, but could not\n" +
        "maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier work as cooks\n" +
        "assistant.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former\n" +
        "attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of\n" +
        "attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which\n" +
        "did not spurt for the fellow disciples. Though the new boy was\n" +
        "obviously Sri Yukteswars favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal\n" +
        "idiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity\n" +
        "to the pattern of life. My nature is seldom commandeered by a detail;\n" +
        "I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessible benefit than\n" +
        "an outward praise.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply\n" +
        "hurt.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your head is swelling to the bursting point! I added a warning\n" +
        "whose truth I felt intuitively: Unless you mend your ways, someday\n" +
        "you will be asked to leave this ashram.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who\n" +
        "had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired\n" +
        "meekly to a corner.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Maybe Mukunda is right. Masters reply to the boy came with\n" +
        "unusual coldness. I escaped without castigation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home.\n" +
        "He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never\n" +
        "authoritatively controlled his disciples movements. On the boys\n" +
        "return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly\n" +
        "apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face.\n" +
        "Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who had lately\n" +
        "acquired a number of evil habits.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the\n" +
        "boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the\n" +
        "ashram tomorrow; I cant do it! Tears stood in Sri Yukteswars\n" +
        "eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. The boy would never have\n" +
        "fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to\n" +
        "mix with undesirable companions. He has rejected my protection;\n" +
        "the callous world must be his guru still.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kumars departure brought me no elation; sadly I wondered how one\n" +
        "with power to win a masters love could ever respond to cheaper\n" +
        "allures. Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man,\n" +
        "and require no delicacies of perception for their appreciation.\n" +
        "Sense wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with\n" +
        "its multicolored flowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The\n" +
        "land of healing lies within, radiant with that happiness blindly\n" +
        "sought in a thousand misdirections. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Keen intelligence is two-edged, Master once remarked in reference\n" +
        "to Kumars brilliant mind. It may be used constructively or\n" +
        "destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance,\n" +
        "or to decapitate ones self. Intelligence is rightly guided only\n" +
        "after the mind has acknowledged the inescapability of spiritual\n" +
        "law.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru mixed freely with men and women disciples, treating\n" +
        "all as his children. Perceiving their soul equality, he showed no\n" +
        "distinction or partiality.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman, he\n" +
        "said. Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one,\n" +
        "so the soul, impersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul\n" +
        "is the pure, changeless image of God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction.\n" +
        "Men, he said, were also a temptation to women. I once inquired of\n" +
        "my guru why a great ancient saint had called women the door to\n" +
        "hell.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A girl must have proved very troublesome to his peace of mind in\n" +
        "his early life, my guru answered causticly. Otherwise he would have\n" +
        "denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage,\n" +
        "Master would maintain an unresponsive silence. Do not allow yourself\n" +
        "to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face, he told\n" +
        "the disciples. How can sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle\n" +
        "flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice\n" +
        "discriminations are lost to the man of elemental lusts.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Students seeking to escape from the dualistic MAYA delusion received\n" +
        "from Sri Yukteswar patient and understanding counsel.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Just as the purpose of eating is to satisfy hunger, not greed,\n" +
        "so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation of the species\n" +
        "according to natural law, never for the kindling of insatiable\n" +
        "longings, he said. Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they\n" +
        "will follow you after the astral body is torn from its physical\n" +
        "casing. Even when the flesh is weak, the mind should be constantly\n" +
        "resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it\n" +
        "by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion\n" +
        "can be mastered.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Conserve your powers. Be like the capacious ocean, absorbing\n" +
        "within all the tributary rivers of the senses. Small yearnings are\n" +
        "openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing\n" +
        "waters to be wasted in the desert soil of materialism. The forceful\n" +
        "activating impulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy to the\n" +
        "happiness of man. Roam in the world as a lion of self-control;\n" +
        "see that the frogs of weakness dont kick you around.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The devotee is finally freed from all instinctive compulsions. He\n" +

        "alone, a love solitary because omnipresent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares\n" +
        "where I had first visited my guru. Gracious and kindly, she was\n" +
        "yet a woman of very decided opinions. I stood on her balcony one\n" +
        "day and watched mother and son talking together. In his quiet,\n" +
        "sensible way, Master was trying to convince her about something.\n" +
        "He was apparently unsuccessful, for she shook her head with great\n" +
        "vigor.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Nay, nay, my son, go away now! Your wise words are not for me! I\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar backed away without further argument, like a scolded\n" +
        "child. I was touched at his great respect for his mother even in\n" +
        "her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a\n" +
        "sage. There was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied\n" +
        "a sidelight on my gurus unusual nature, inwardly humble and\n" +
        "outwardly unbendable.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection\n" +
        "with worldly ties after their formal severance. He cannot perform\n" +
        "the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder.\n" +
        "Yet Shankara, the ancient founder of the Swami Order, disregarded\n" +
        "the injunctions. At the death of his beloved mother, he cremated her\n" +
        "body with heavenly fire which he caused to spurt from his upraised\n" +
        "hand.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less\n" +
        "spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crematory\n" +
        "services by the holy Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in\n" +
        "conformance with age-old custom.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The SHASTRIC prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome\n" +
        "narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yukteswar had wholly merged\n" +
        "their beings in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by\n" +
        "rule. Sometimes, too, a master purposely ignores a canon in order\n" +
        "to uphold its principle as superior to and independent of form. Thus\n" +
        "Jesus plucked ears of corn on the day of rest. To the inevitable\n" +

        "the sabbath. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Outside of the scriptures, seldom was a book honored by Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars perusal. Yet he was invariably acquainted with the\n" +
        "latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge.\n" +
        "A brilliant conversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on\n" +
        "countless topics with his guests. My gurus ready wit and rollicking\n" +
        "laugh enlivened every discussion. Often grave, Master was never\n" +
        "gloomy. To seek the Lord, one need not disfigure his face, he\n" +
        "would remark. Remember that finding God will mean the funeral of\n" +

        "\n" +

        "to the hermitage, a number arrived for their first visit with the\n" +
        "expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist. A supercilious\n" +
        "smile or a glance of amused tolerance occasionally betrayed that\n" +
        "the newcomers anticipated nothing more than a few pious platitudes.\n" +
        "Yet their reluctant departure would bring an expressed conviction\n" +

        "\n" +
        "My guru ordinarily was gentle and affable to guests; his welcome was\n" +
        "given with charming cordiality. Yet inveterate egotists sometimes\n" +
        "suffered an invigorating shock. They confronted in Master either\n" +
        "a frigid indifference or a formidable opposition: ice or iron!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A noted chemist once crossed swords with Sri Yukteswar. The\n" +
        "visitor would not admit the existence of God, inasmuch as science\n" +
        "has devised no means of detecting Him.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "\n" +

        "distance from the visitor. But what original commentary can you\n" +
        "supply, from the uniqueness of your particular life? What holy\n" +
        "text have you absorbed and made your own? In what ways have these\n" +

        "These bloodless pedants smell unduly of the lamp, my guru remarked\n" +
        "after the departure of the chastened one. They prefer philosophy\n" +
        "to be a gentle intellectual setting-up exercise. Their elevated\n" +

        "Another half hour slipped away. The master gave a brief comment.\n" +
        "Motionless, they meditated again for an hour. Finally the guru\n" +

        "\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Thousands have replied to me differently! The great sage smiled\n" +

        "I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, but your purpose was good, so\n" +
        "I awaited you. He shook his finger in my astounded face. Arent\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Considering that introduction of myself would be mere verbosity in\n" +

        "\n" +
        "All-pervading, eh? The saint chuckled. Then why, young sir,\n" +
        "did you fail to bow before the Infinite in the stone symbol at the\n" +
        "Tarakeswar temple yesterday? Your pride caused you the\n" +
        "punishment of being misdirected by the passer-by who was not bothered\n" +
        "by fine distinctions of left and right. Today, too, you have had\n" +
        "a fairly uncomfortable time of it!\n" +
        "\n" +

        "the highest road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering\n" +
        "the Lord within, we soon perceive Him without. Holy shrines at\n" +
        "Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear centers\n" +
        "of spiritual power.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Young yogi, I see you are running away from your master. He\n" +
        "has everything you need; you must return to him. Mountains cannot\n" +
        "be your guru. Ram Gopal was repeating the same thought which Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar had expressed at our last meeting.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Masters are under no cosmic compulsion to limit their residence.\n" +
        "My companion glanced at me quizzically. The Himalayas in India\n" +
        "and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What one does not trouble to\n" +
        "find within will not be discovered by transporting the body hither\n" +
        "and yon. As soon as the devotee is WILLING to go even to the ends\n" +
        "of the earth for spiritual enlightenment, his guru appears near-by.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage,\n" +
        "followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar in a crowded lane.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door\n" +
        "and be alone?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes. I reflected that this saint descended from the general to\n" +
        "the particular with disconcerting speed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That is your cave. The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination\n" +
        "which I have never forgotten. That is your sacred mountain. That\n" +
        "is where you will find the kingdom of God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His simple words instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for\n" +
        "the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field I awoke from the monticolous\n" +
        "dreams of eternal snows.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Young sir, your divine thirst is laudable. I feel great love for\n" +
        "you. Ram Gopal took my hand and led me to a quaint hamlet. The\n" +
        "adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with\n" +
        "rustic entrances.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small\n" +
        "cottage. After giving me sweetened lime juice and a piece of rock\n" +
        "candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In about\n" +
        "four hours I opened my meditative eyes and saw that the moonlit\n" +
        "figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly reminding\n" +
        "my stomach that man does not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached\n" +
        "me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see you are famished; food will be ready soon.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A fire was kindled under a clay oven on the patio; rice and DHAL\n" +
        "were quickly served on large banana leaves. My host courteously\n" +
        "refused my aid in all cooking chores. The guest is God, a Hindu\n" +
        "proverb, has commanded devout observance from time immemorial. In\n" +
        "my later world travels, I was charmed to see that a similar respect\n" +
        "for visitors is manifested in rural sections of many countries.\n" +
        "The city dweller finds the keen edge of hospitality blunted by\n" +
        "superabundance of strange faces.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The marts of men seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi\n" +
        "in the isolation of the tiny jungle village. The cottage room\n" +
        "was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn\n" +
        "blankets on the floor for my bed, and seated himself on a straw\n" +
        "mat. Overwhelmed by his spiritual magnetism, I ventured a request.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, why dont you grant me a SAMADHI?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dear one, I would be glad to convey the divine contact, but it\n" +
        "is not my place to do so. The saint looked at me with half-closed\n" +
        "eyes. Your master will bestow that experience shortly. Your body\n" +
        "is not tuned just yet. As a small lamp cannot withstand excessive\n" +
        "electrical voltage, so your nerves are unready for the cosmic\n" +
        "current. If I gave you the infinite ecstasy right now, you would\n" +
        "burn as if every cell were on fire.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are asking illumination from me, the yogi continued musingly,\n" +
        "while I am wondering-inconsiderable as I am, and with the little\n" +
        "meditation I have done-if I have succeeded in pleasing God, and\n" +
        "what worth I may find in His eyes at the final reckoning.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, have you not been singleheartedly seeking God for a long\n" +
        "time?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have not done much. Behari must have told you something of\n" +
        "my life. For twenty years I occupied a secret grotto, meditating\n" +
        "eighteen hours a day. Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave\n" +
        "and remained there for twenty-five years, entering the yoga union\n" +
        "for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was ever\n" +
        "with God. My body was more rested in the complete calmness of the\n" +
        "superconsciousness than it could be by the partial peace of the\n" +
        "ordinary subconscious state.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The muscles relax during sleep, but the heart, lungs, and\n" +
        "circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In\n" +
        "superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a state of suspended\n" +
        "animation, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such means I have\n" +
        "found it unnecessary to sleep for years. The time will come when\n" +
        "you too will dispense with sleep.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My goodness, you have meditated for so long and yet are unsure\n" +
        "of the Lords favor! I gazed at him in astonishment. Then what\n" +
        "about us poor mortals?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Well, dont you see, my dear boy, that God is Eternity Itself? To\n" +
        "assume that one can fully know Him by forty-five years of meditation\n" +
        "is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however,\n" +
        "that even a little meditation saves one from the dire fear of death\n" +
        "and after-death states. Do not fix your spiritual ideal on a small\n" +
        "mountain, but hitch it to the star of unqualified divine attainment.\n" +
        "If you work hard, you will get there.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Enthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening\n" +
        "words. He related a wondrous story of his first meeting with Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasayas guru, Babaji. Around midnight Ram Gopal fell\n" +
        "into silence, and I lay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I\n" +
        "saw flashes of lightning; the vast space within me was a chamber\n" +
        "of molten light. I opened my eyes and observed the same dazzling\n" +
        "radiance. The room became a part of that infinite vault which I\n" +
        "beheld with interior vision.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why dont you go to sleep?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, how can I sleep in the presence of lightning, blazing whether\n" +
        "my eyes are shut or open?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are blessed to have this experience; the spiritual radiations\n" +
        "are not easily seen. The saint added a few words of affection.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candies and said I must depart. I\n" +
        "felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down\n" +
        "my cheeks.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will not let you go empty-handed. The yogi spoke tenderly. I\n" +
        "will do something for you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the\n" +
        "ground, peace rushing like a mighty flood through the gates of my\n" +
        "eyes. I was instantaneously healed of a pain in my back, which had\n" +
        "troubled me intermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of\n" +
        "luminous joy, I wept no more. After touching the saints feet, I\n" +
        "sauntered into the jungle, making my way through its tropical tangle\n" +
        "until I reached Tarakeswar.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There I made a second pilgrimage to the famous shrine, and prostrated\n" +
        "myself fully before the altar. The round stone enlarged before\n" +
        "my inner vision until it became the cosmical spheres, ring within\n" +
        "ring, zone after zone, all dowered with divinity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I entrained happily an hour later for Calcutta. My travels ended,\n" +
        "not in the lofty mountains, but in the Himalayan presence of my\n" +
        "Master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am here, Guruji. My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for\n" +
        "me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us go to the kitchen and find something to eat. Sri Yukteswars\n" +
        "manner was as natural as if hours and not days had separated us.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master, I must have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from\n" +
        "my duties here; I thought you might be angry with me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, of course not! Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I\n" +
        "do not expect anything from others, so their actions cannot be in\n" +
        "opposition to wishes of mine. I would not use you for my own ends;\n" +
        "I am happy only in your own true happiness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, one hears of divine love in a vague way, but for the first\n" +
        "time I am having a concrete example in your angelic self! In the\n" +
        "world, even a father does not easily forgive his son if he leaves\n" +
        "his parents business without warning. But you show not the slightest\n" +
        "vexation, though you must have been put to great inconvenience by\n" +
        "the many unfinished tasks I left behind.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We looked into each others eyes, where tears were shining. A\n" +
        "blissful wave engulfed me; I was conscious that the Lord, in the\n" +
        "form of my guru, was expanding the small ardors of my heart into\n" +
        "the incompressible reaches of cosmic love.\n" +

        "So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dr Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage.\n" +
        "After Master had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most\n" +
        "part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why bring a dead man to the ashram? Sri Yukteswar looked at me\n" +
        "inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir! The doctor is very much alive!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But in a short time he will be dead.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was shocked. Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh\n" +
        "yet hopes for time to change his fathers materialistic views. I\n" +
        "beseech you, Master, to help the man.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Very well; for your sake. My gurus face was impassive. The\n" +
        "proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not\n" +
        "know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians\n" +
        "will give him up for lost; his natural time to leave this earth is\n" +
        "six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that\n" +
        "date he will recover. But there is one condition. You must get\n" +
        "him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless object as\n" +
        "violently as one of his horses before an operation! Master chuckled.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could\n" +
        "best employ the arts of cajolery on the recalcitrant doctor, Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar made further disclosures.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As soon as the man gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will\n" +
        "not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is\n" +
        "feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension\n" +
        "of life is granted him only because of your plea.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet\n" +
        "at the jewelers. It was ready in a week, but Dr Roy refused to\n" +
        "put it on.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these\n" +
        "astrological superstitions. The doctor glanced at me belligerently.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared\n" +
        "the man to a balky horse. Another seven days passed; the doctor,\n" +
        "suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later\n" +
        "the physician in attendance told me that his patients case was\n" +
        "hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted\n" +
        "by diabetes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I shook my head. My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting\n" +
        "one month, Dr Roy will be well.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a\n" +
        "fortnight later, with an apologetic air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dr Roy has made a complete recovery! he exclaimed. It is the\n" +
        "most amazing case in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying\n" +
        "man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be\n" +
        "a healing prophet!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After one interview with Dr Roy, during which I repeated Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man\n" +
        "again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat\n" +
        "on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly\n" +
        "regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not\n" +
        "influenced me. It was true that Dr Roy looked a picture of health.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the\n" +
        "next block. This morning Father dropped dead!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This case was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He\n" +
        "healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief,\n" +
        "and extended the mans natural term on earth by six months, just\n" +
        "because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in\n" +
        "his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my\n" +
        "guru. Many of them would lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their\n" +
        "fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in\n" +
        "Serampore. Master became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented\n" +
        "that his private life was wild and disorderly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously\n" +
        "ill. Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation.\n" +
        "Mukunda is the witness: dont say later that I didnt warn you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sasi laughed. Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet\n" +
        "charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My spirit is willing but my\n" +
        "will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing\n" +
        "else.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help\n" +
        "you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I cant afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully\n" +
        "believe you will protect me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In a year you will bring three sapphires, Sri Yukteswar replied\n" +
        "cryptically. They will be of no use then.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Variations on this conversation took place regularly. I cant\n" +
        "reform! Sasi would say in comical despair. And my trust in you,\n" +
        "Master, is more precious to me than any stone!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his\n" +
        "disciple, Naren Babu. About ten oclock in the morning, as Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor,\n" +
        "I heard the front door open. Master straightened stiffly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is that Sasi, he remarked gravely. The year is now up; both\n" +
        "his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I dont\n" +
        "want to see him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Half stunned by Sri Yukteswars sternness, I raced down the stairway.\n" +
        "Sasi was ascending.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O Mukunda! I do hope Master is here; I had a hunch he might be.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, but he doesnt wish to be disturbed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars feet, placing there three beautiful sapphires.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have galloping tuberculosis!\n" +
        "They give me no longer than three more months! I humbly implore\n" +
        "your aid; I know you can heal me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Isnt it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart\n" +
        "with your jewels; their time of usefulness is past. Master then\n" +
        "sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boys\n" +
        "sobs for mercy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely\n" +
        "testing the depth of Sasis faith in the divine healing power. I was\n" +
        "not surprised a tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic\n" +
        "gaze on my prostrate friend.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other peoples houses!\n" +
        "Return your sapphires to the jewelers; they are an unnecessary\n" +
        "expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not;\n" +
        "in a few weeks you shall be well.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sasis smile illumined his tear-marred face like sudden sun over\n" +
        "a sodden landscape. Beloved guru, shall I take the medicines\n" +
        "prescribed by the doctors?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars glance was longanimous. Just as you wish-drink\n" +
        "them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for\n" +
        "the sun and moon to interchange their positions than for you to\n" +
        "die of tuberculosis. He added abruptly, Go now, before I change\n" +
        "my mind!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him\n" +
        "several times during the next few weeks, and was aghast to find\n" +
        "his condition increasingly worse.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sasi cannot last through the night. These words from his physician,\n" +
        "and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton,\n" +
        "sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my\n" +
        "tearful report.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure\n" +
        "Sasi of his recovery.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking\n" +
        "eyes half-open, their vision fled to another world.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I returned at once to Sasis home in Calcutta. With astonishment\n" +
        "I found my friend sitting up, drinking milk.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Masters presence\n" +
        "in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel\n" +
        "that through his grace I am entirely well.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever\n" +
        "before. But his singular reaction to his healing had an\n" +
        "ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend\n" +
        "told me one day that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of\n" +
        "life that he was ashamed to face Master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I could only conclude that Sasis illness had had the contrasting\n" +
        "effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The first two years of my course at Scottish Church College were\n" +
        "drawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic;\n" +
        "what little studying I did was only to keep peace with my family.\n" +
        "My two private tutors came regularly to my house; I was regularly\n" +
        "absent: I can discern at least this one regularity in my scholastic\n" +
        "career!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In India two successful years of college bring an Intermediate Arts\n" +
        "diploma; the student may then look forward to another two years\n" +
        "and his AB degree.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead.\n" +
        "I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely\n" +
        "hoping that he would sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I\n" +
        "related my embarrassing unpreparedness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Master smiled consolingly. You have wholeheartedly pursued\n" +
        "your spiritual duties, and could not help neglecting your college\n" +
        "work. Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week:\n" +
        "you shall get through your ordeal without failure.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts\n" +
        "that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the\n" +
        "mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a\n" +
        "wilderness. A long period of meditation brought me a labor-saving\n" +
        "inspiration. Opening each book at random, I studied only those\n" +
        "pages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen\n" +
        "hours a day for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all\n" +
        "succeeding generations on the art of cramming.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following days in the examination halls were a justification\n" +
        "of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, though\n" +
        "by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were\n" +
        "ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise.\n" +
        "Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will see that you pursue\n" +
        "your last two years of university work right here in Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was puzzled. Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this\n" +
        "town. Serampore College, the sole institution of higher learning,\n" +
        "offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master smiled mischievously. I am too old to go about collecting\n" +
        "donations to establish an AB college for you. I guess I shall\n" +
        "have to arrange the matter through someone else.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Two months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College,\n" +
        "publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient\n" +
        "funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch\n" +
        "affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first\n" +
        "students to enroll in Serampore as an AB candidate.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave\n" +
        "Calcutta and be near you every day in Serampore. Professor Howells\n" +
        "does not dream how much he owes to your silent help!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock severity. Now you wont have\n" +
        "to spend so many hours on trains; what a lot of free time for your\n" +
        "studies! Perhaps you will become less of a last-minute crammer and\n" +
        "more of a scholar. But somehow his tone lacked conviction.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years ago, right in this very room you now occupy, a Mohammedan\n" +
        "wonder-worker performed four miracles before me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar made this surprising statement during his first visit\n" +
        "to my new quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College,\n" +
        "I had taken a room in a near-by boardinghouse, called PANTHI. It\n" +
        "was an old-fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master, what a coincidence! Are these newly decorated walls really\n" +
        "ancient with memories? I looked around my simply furnished room\n" +
        "with awakened interest.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is a long story. My guru smiled reminiscently. The name of\n" +
        "the FAKIR was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary\n" +
        "powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water. A dust-covered SANNYASI\n" +
        "made this request of Afzal one day during his early boyhood in a\n" +
        "small village of eastern Bengal.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master, I am a Mohammedan. How could you, a Hindu, accept a drink\n" +
        "from my hands?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe\n" +
        "the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; bring me water\n" +
        "quickly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Afzals reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from\n" +
        "the yogi.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You possess good karma from former lives, he observed solemnly.\n" +
        "I am going to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you\n" +
        "command over one of the invisible realms. The great powers that\n" +
        "will be yours should be exercised for worthy ends; never employ\n" +
        "them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have brought over from\n" +
        "the past some seeds of destructive tendencies. Do not allow them\n" +
        "to sprout by watering them with fresh evil actions. The complexity\n" +
        "of your previous karma is such that you must use this life to\n" +
        "reconcile your yogic accomplishments with the highest humanitarian\n" +
        "goals.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the\n" +
        "master vanished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His\n" +
        "miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that\n" +
        "he was always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called\n" +
        "Hazrat. This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIRS\n" +
        "slightest wish.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ignoring his masters warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers.\n" +
        "Whatever object he touched and then replaced would soon disappear\n" +
        "without a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the\n" +
        "Mohammedan an objectionable guest!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time,\n" +
        "representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled\n" +
        "would vanish shortly after he had left the shop.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted\n" +
        "by the hope of learning his secrets. The FAKIR occasionally invited\n" +
        "them to travel with him. At the railway station he would manage\n" +
        "to touch a roll of tickets. These he would return to the clerk,\n" +
        "remarking: I have changed my mind, and wont buy them now.\n" +
        "But when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal would be in\n" +
        "possession of the required tickets. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "These exploits created an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and\n" +
        "ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police\n" +
        "who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the FAKIR\n" +
        "could remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: Hazrat, take\n" +
        "this away.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my\n" +
        "room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear\n" +
        "more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This PANTHI house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became\n" +
        "acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend also invited\n" +
        "about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then,\n" +
        "and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR. Master\n" +
        "laughed. I took the precaution of not wearing anything valuable!\n" +
        "Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a\n" +
        "smooth stone and write your name on it with chalk; then throw the\n" +
        "stone as far as possible into the Ganges.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves,\n" +
        "the Mohammedan addressed me again:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Fill a pot with Ganges water near the front of this house.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried,\n" +
        "Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found\n" +
        "my signature as legible as when I had written it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babu, one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy\n" +
        "antique gold watch and chain. The FAKIR examined them with ominous\n" +
        "admiration. Soon they were missing!\n" +
        "\n" +

        "The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, You\n" +
        "have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. Bring them to me, and I\n" +
        "will tell you where to locate your timepiece.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He came back\n" +
        "shortly and handed Afzal the required sum.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Go to the little bridge near your house, the FAKIR instructed\n" +
        "Babu. Call on Hazrat to give you the watch and chain.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief\n" +
        "and no jewelry whatever.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I commanded Hazrat as directed, he announced, my watch\n" +
        "came tumbling down from the air into my right hand! You may be sure\n" +
        "I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babus friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a\n" +
        "watch, were staring with resentment at Afzal. He now spoke placatingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please name any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A number asked for milk, others for fruit juices. I was not too\n" +
        "much shocked when the unnerved Babu requested whisky! The Mohammedan\n" +
        "gave an order; the obliging Hazrat sent sealed containers sailing\n" +
        "down the air and thudding to the floor. Each man found his desired\n" +
        "beverage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The promise of the fourth spectacular feat of the day was doubtless\n" +
        "gratifying to our host: Afzal offered to supply an instantaneous\n" +
        "lunch!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us order the most expensive dishes, Babu suggested gloomily.\n" +
        "I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees! Everything\n" +
        "should be served on gold plates!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As soon as each man had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed\n" +
        "himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A great rattle ensued; gold\n" +
        "platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and\n" +
        "many out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All\n" +
        "the food was delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to\n" +
        "leave the room. A tremendous noise, as though dishes were being\n" +
        "piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! there was no sign of the\n" +
        "glittering plates or the remnants of the meal.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, I interrupted, if Afzal could easily secure such things\n" +
        "as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually, Sri Yukteswar\n" +
        "explained. His mastery of a certain yoga technique gave him access\n" +
        "to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized.\n" +
        "Through the agency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could\n" +
        "summon the atoms of any object from etheric energy by an act of\n" +
        "powerful will. But such astrally-produced objects are structurally\n" +
        "evanescent; they cannot be long retained. Afzal still yearned for\n" +
        "worldly wealth which, though more hardly earned, has a more dependable\n" +
        "durability.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I laughed. It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Afzal was not a man of God-realization, Master went on. Miracles\n" +
        "of a permanent and beneficial nature are performed by true saints\n" +
        "because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.\n" +
        "Afzal was merely an ordinary man with an extraordinary power of\n" +
        "penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until\n" +
        "death.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I understand now, Guruji. The after-world appears to have some\n" +
        "charming features.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master agreed. I never saw Afzal after that day, but a few years\n" +
        "later Babu came to my home to show me a newspaper account of the\n" +
        "Mohammedans public confession. From it I learned the facts I have\n" +
        "just told you about Afzals early initiation from a Hindu guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled\n" +
        "by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: I, Afzal Khan, am writing these\n" +
        "words as an act of penance and as a warning to those who seek the\n" +
        "possession of miraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the\n" +
        "wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of God and my\n" +
        "master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the\n" +
        "ordinary laws of morality. My day of reckoning finally arrived.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Recently I met an old man on a road outside Calcutta. He limped\n" +
        "along painfully, carrying a shining object which looked like gold.\n" +
        "I addressed him with greed in my heart.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am Afzal Khan, the great FAKIR. What have you there?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no\n" +
        "interest to a FAKIR. I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I touched the ball and walked away without reply. The old man\n" +
        "hobbled after me. He soon raised an outcry: My gold is gone!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian voice\n" +
        "that issued oddly from his frail body:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do you not recognize me?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this\n" +
        "unimpressive old cripple was none other than the great saint who,\n" +
        "long, long ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself;\n" +
        "his body instantly became strong and youthful.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So! My gurus glance was fiery. I see with my own eyes that\n" +
        "you use your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey\n" +
        "on it like a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is\n" +
        "now freed from you. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I called on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the first time, he did\n" +
        "not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil suddenly lifted\n" +
        "within me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my long delusion. I\n" +
        "was sobbing at his feet. I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions.\n" +
        "I will retire to the mountains for lonely meditation on God, hoping\n" +
        "to atone for my evil past.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My master regarded me with silent compassion. I feel your\n" +
        "sincerity, he said finally. Because of your earlier years of\n" +
        "strict obedience, and because of your present repentance, I will\n" +
        "grant you one boon. Your other powers are now gone, but whenever\n" +
        "food and clothing are needed, you may still call successfully on\n" +
        "Hazrat to supply them. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to divine\n" +
        "understanding in the mountain solitudes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru then vanished; I was left to my tears and reflections.\n" +
        "Farewell, world! I go to seek the forgiveness of the Cosmic Beloved.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am often beset by atheistic doubts. Yet a torturing surmise\n" +
        "sometimes haunts me: may not untapped soul possibilities exist? Is\n" +
        "man not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the PANTHI boardinghouse,\n" +
        "were called forth by my invitation that he meet my guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into KRIYA YOGA, I replied.\n" +
        "It calms the dualistic turmoil by a divine inner certainty.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Masters\n" +
        "presence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon\n" +
        "a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not\n" +
        "enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswars\n" +
        "words Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful,\n" +
        "then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer self within his\n" +
        "bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample\n" +
        "enough for the Spirit.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As Dijen and I were both pursuing the AB course at Serampore\n" +
        "College, we got into the habit of walking together to the ashram\n" +
        "as soon as classes were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar\n" +
        "standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with\n" +
        "a smile.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me\n" +
        "at the door with disappointing news.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following day I received a post card from my guru. I shall\n" +
        "leave Calcutta Wednesday morning, he had written. You and Dijen\n" +
        "meet the nine oclock train at Serampore station.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my mind: I am delayed; dont\n" +
        "meet the nine oclock train.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed\n" +
        "for departure.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You and your intuition! My friends voice was edged in scorn. I\n" +
        "prefer to trust Masters written word.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality.\n" +
        "Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily\n" +
        "behind him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking\n" +
        "the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense\n" +
        "brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished.\n" +
        "Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized\n" +
        "figure of Sri Yukteswar!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt\n" +
        "before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at\n" +
        "my gurus feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to\n" +
        "me, of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth\n" +
        "brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his\n" +
        "robe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of\n" +
        "his toes within them. Too much astounded to utter a word, I stood\n" +
        "up and gazed at him questioningly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was pleased that you got my telepathic message. Masters voice\n" +
        "was calm, entirely normal. I have now finished my business in\n" +
        "Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten oclock train.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, This is not\n" +
        "an apparition, but my flesh and blood form. I have been divinely\n" +
        "commanded to give you this experience, rare to achieve on earth.\n" +
        "Meet me at the station; you and Dijen will see me coming toward you,\n" +
        "dressed as I am now. I shall be preceded by a fellow passenger-a\n" +
        "little boy carrying a silver jug.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru placed both hands on my head, with a murmured blessing. As\n" +
        "he concluded with the words, TABA ASI, I heard a peculiar\n" +
        "rumbling sound. His body began to melt gradually within\n" +
        "the piercing light. First his feet and legs vanished, then his\n" +
        "torso and head, like a scroll being rolled up. To the very last, I\n" +
        "could feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence\n" +
        "faded; nothing remained before me but the barred window and a pale\n" +
        "stream of sunlight.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I remained in a half-stupor of confusion, questioning whether I had\n" +
        "not been the victim of a hallucination. A crestfallen Dijen soon\n" +
        "entered the room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master was not on the nine oclock train, nor even the nine-thirty.\n" +
        "My friend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come then; I know he will arrive at ten oclock. I took Dijens\n" +
        "hand and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests.\n" +
        "In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was\n" +
        "already puffing to a halt.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The whole train is filled with the light of Masters aura! He is\n" +
        "there! I exclaimed joyfully.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You dream so? Dijen laughed mockingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let us wait here. I told my friend details of the way in which our\n" +
        "guru would approach us. As I finished my description, Sri Yukteswar\n" +
        "came into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short time\n" +
        "earlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a\n" +
        "silver jug.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "For a moment a wave of cold fear passed through me, at the\n" +
        "unprecedented strangeness of my experience. I felt the materialistic,\n" +
        "twentieth-century world slipping from me; was I back in the ancient\n" +
        "days when Jesus appeared before Peter on the sea?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where\n" +
        "Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, Master smiled at my friend\n" +
        "and remarked:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dijen was silent, but glared at me suspiciously. After we\n" +
        "had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded\n" +
        "toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation\n" +
        "streaming from his every pore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So! Master sent me a message! Yet you concealed it! I demand an\n" +
        "explanation!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Can I help it if your mental mirror oscillates with such restlessness\n" +
        "that you cannot register our gurus instructions? I retorted.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The anger vanished from Dijens face. I see what you mean, he\n" +
        "said ruefully. But please explain how you could know about the\n" +
        "child with the jug.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "By the time I had finished the story of Masters phenomenal\n" +
        "appearance at the boardinghouse that morning, my friend and I had\n" +
        "reached Serampore College.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The account I have just heard of our gurus powers, Dijen said,\n" +
        "makes me feel that any university in the world is only a kindergarten.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father, I want to invite Master and four friends to accompany me\n" +
        "to the Himalayan foothills during my summer vacation. May I have\n" +
        "six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel\n" +
        "expenses?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I had expected, Father laughed heartily. This is the third time\n" +
        "you have given me the same cock-and-bull story. Didnt you make a\n" +
        "similar request last summer, and the year before that? At the last\n" +
        "moment, Sri Yukteswarji refuses to go.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is true, Father; I dont know why my guru will not give me his\n" +
        "definite word about Kashmir. But if I tell him that I have\n" +
        "already secured the passes from you, somehow I think that this time\n" +
        "he will consent to make the journey.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Father was unconvinced at the moment, but the following day, after\n" +
        "some good-humored gibes, he handed me six passes and a roll of\n" +
        "ten-rupee bills.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I hardly think your theoretical trip needs such practical props,\n" +
        "he remarked, but here they are.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That afternoon I exhibited my booty to Sri Yukteswar. Though he\n" +
        "smiled at my enthusiasm, his words were noncommittal: I would like\n" +
        "to go; we shall see. He made no comment when I asked his little\n" +
        "hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I also invited three\n" +
        "other friends--Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin Auddy, and one other boy.\n" +
        "Our date of departure was set for the following Monday.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Calcutta, where marriage rites\n" +
        "for a cousin were being celebrated at my family home. I arrived in\n" +
        "Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajendra met me at\n" +
        "the hermitage door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master is out, walking. He has refused to go.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was equally grieved and obdurate. I will not give Father a third\n" +
        "chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for Kashmir. Come; the rest\n" +
        "of us will go anyhow.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rajendra agreed; I left the ashram to find a servant. Kanai, I knew,\n" +
        "would not take the trip without Master, and someone was needed to\n" +
        "look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously\n" +
        "a servant in my family home, who was now employed by a Serampore\n" +
        "schoolmaster. As I walked along briskly, I met my guru in front\n" +
        "of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Where are you going? Sri Yukteswars face was unsmiling.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not take the trip we have been\n" +
        "planning. I am seeking Behari. You will recall that last year he\n" +
        "was so anxious to see Kashmir that he even offered to serve without\n" +
        "pay.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I remember. Nevertheless, I dont think Behari will be willing to\n" +
        "go.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was exasperated. He is just eagerly waiting for this opportunity!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru silently resumed his walk; I soon reached the schoolmasters\n" +
        "house. Behari, in the courtyard, greeted me with a friendly warmth\n" +
        "that abruptly vanished as soon as I mentioned Kashmir. With a murmured\n" +
        "word of apology, the servant left me and entered his employers\n" +
        "house. I waited half an hour, nervously assuring myself that\n" +
        "Beharis delay was being caused by preparations for his trip.\n" +
        "Finally I knocked at the front door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Behari left by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago, a man\n" +
        "informed me. A slight smile hovered about his lips.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I departed sadly, wondering whether my invitation had been too\n" +
        "coercive or whether Masters unseen influence were at work. Passing\n" +
        "the Christian church, again I saw my guru walking slowly toward\n" +
        "me. Without waiting to hear my report, he exclaimed:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So Behari would not go! Now, what are your plans?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I felt like a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his\n" +
        "masterful father. Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his\n" +
        "servant, Lal Dhari.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "See your uncle if you want to, Sri Yukteswar replied with a\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Apprehensive but rebellious, I left my guru and entered Serampore\n" +
        "Courthouse. My paternal uncle, Sarada Ghosh, a government attorney,\n" +
        "welcomed me affectionately.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir, I told him.\n" +

        "your journey more comfortable?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These kind words gave me a lift of encouragement. Dear uncle, I\n" +
        "said, could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My simple request had the effect of an earthquake. Uncle jumped so\n" +
        "violently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in\n" +
        "every direction, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble,\n" +
        "fell to the floor with a great clatter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You selfish young man, he shouted, quivering with wrath, what a\n" +
        "preposterous idea! Who will look after me, if you take my servant\n" +
        "on one of your pleasure jaunts?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I concealed my surprise, reflecting that my amiable uncles sudden\n" +
        "change of front was only one more enigma in a day fully devoted\n" +
        "to incomprehensibility. My retreat from the courthouse office was\n" +
        "more alacritous than dignified.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I returned to the hermitage, where my friends were expectantly\n" +
        "gathered. Conviction was growing on me that some sufficient if\n" +
        "exceedingly recondite motive was behind Masters attitude. Remorse\n" +
        "seized me that I had been trying to thwart my gurus will.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mukunda, wouldnt you like to stay awhile longer with me? Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar inquired. Rajendra and the others can go ahead now, and\n" +
        "wait for you at Calcutta. There will be plenty of time to catch\n" +
        "the last evening train leaving Calcutta for Kashmir.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I dont care to go without you, I said mournfully.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My friends paid not the slightest attention to my remark. They\n" +
        "summoned a hackney carriage and departed with all the luggage.\n" +
        "Kanai and I sat quietly at our gurus feet. After a half hour of\n" +
        "complete silence, Master rose and walked toward the second-floor\n" +
        "dining patio.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kanai, please serve Mukundas food. His train leaves soon.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Getting up from my blanket seat, I staggered suddenly with nausea\n" +
        "and a ghastly churning sensation in my stomach. The stabbing pain\n" +
        "was so intense that I felt I had been abruptly hurled into some\n" +
        "violent hell. Groping blindly toward my guru, I collapsed before\n" +
        "him, attacked by all symptoms of the dread Asiatic cholera. Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar and Kanai carried me to the sitting room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Racked with agony, I cried, Master, I surrender my life to you;\n" +

        "body.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar put my head on his lap, stroking my forehead with\n" +

        "\n" +
        "You see now what would have happened if you were at the station\n" +
        "with your friends, he said. I had to look after you in this strange\n" +
        "way, because you chose to doubt my judgment about taking the trip\n" +
        "at this particular time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I understood at last. Inasmuch as great masters seldom see fit to\n" +
        "display their powers openly, a casual observer of the days events\n" +
        "would have imagined that their sequence was quite natural. My gurus\n" +
        "intervention had been too subtle to be suspected. He had worked\n" +
        "his will through Behari and my Uncle Sarada and Rajendra and the\n" +
        "others in such an inconspicuous manner that probably everyone but\n" +
        "myself thought the situations had been logically normal.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As Sri Yukteswar never failed to observe his social obligations,\n" +
        "he instructed Kanai to go for a specialist, and to notify my uncle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master, I protested, only you can heal me. I am too far gone\n" +
        "for any doctor.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Child, you are protected by the Divine Mercy. Dont worry about\n" +
        "the doctor; he will not find you in this state. You are already\n" +
        "healed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With my gurus words, the excruciating suffering left me. I sat up\n" +
        "feebly. A doctor soon arrived and examined me carefully.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You appear to have passed through the worst, he said. I will\n" +
        "take some specimens with me for laboratory tests.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following morning the physician arrived hurriedly. I was sitting\n" +
        "up, in good spirits.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Well, well, here you are, smiling and chatting as though you had\n" +
        "had no close call with death. He patted my hand gently. I hardly\n" +
        "expected to find you alive, after I had discovered from the specimens\n" +
        "that your disease was Asiatic cholera. You are fortunate, young\n" +
        "man, to have a guru with divine healing powers! I am convinced of\n" +
        "it!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I agreed wholeheartedly. As the doctor was preparing to leave,\n" +
        "Rajendra and Auddy appeared at the door. The resentment in their\n" +
        "faces changed into sympathy as they glanced at the physician and\n" +
        "then at my somewhat wan countenance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We were angry when you didnt turn up as agreed at the Calcutta\n" +
        "train. You have been sick?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes. I could not help laughing as my friends placed the luggage\n" +
        "in the same corner it had occupied yesterday. I quoted: There was\n" +
        "a ship that went to Spain; when it arrived, it came back again!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master entered the room. I permitted myself a convalescents liberty,\n" +
        "and captured his hand lovingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, I said, from my twelfth year on, I have made many\n" +
        "unsuccessful attempts to reach the Himalayas. I am finally convinced\n" +
        "that without your blessings the Goddess Parvati will not\n" +
        "receive me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are strong enough now to travel. I will accompany you to\n" +
        "Kashmir, Sri Yukteswar informed me two days after my miraculous\n" +
        "recovery from Asiatic cholera.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That evening our party of six entrained for the north. Our first\n" +
        "leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly city resting on the throne\n" +
        "of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring\n" +
        "the magnificent views.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "English strawberries for sale, cried an old woman, squatting in\n" +
        "a picturesque open market place.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought\n" +
        "a basketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by.\n" +
        "I tasted one berry but spat it hastily on the ground.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru laughed. Oh, you will like them-in America. At a dinner\n" +
        "there, your hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she\n" +
        "has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say:\n" +
        "What delicious strawberries! Then you will remember this day in\n" +
        "Simla.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswars forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared\n" +
        "there many years later, shortly after my arrival in America. I was\n" +
        "a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata)\n" +
        "in West Somerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries\n" +
        "was put on the table, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my\n" +
        "berries, adding cream and sugar. The fruit is rather tart; I think\n" +
        "you will like it fixed this way, she remarked.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I took a mouthful. What delicious strawberries! I exclaimed.\n" +
        "At once my gurus prediction in Simla emerged from the fathomless\n" +
        "cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that long ago Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswars God-tuned mind had sensitively detected the program of\n" +
        "karmic events wandering in the ether of futurity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There\n" +
        "we hired a large landau, drawn by two horses, in which we started\n" +
        "a seven-day trip to Srinagar, capital city of Kashmir. The second\n" +
        "day of our northbound journey brought into view the true Himalayan\n" +
        "vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the hot,\n" +
        "stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous\n" +
        "grandeur.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, Auddy said to Master, I am greatly enjoying these glorious\n" +
        "scenes in your holy company.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I felt a throb of pleasure at Auddys appreciation, for I was acting\n" +
        "as host on this trip. Sri Yukteswar caught my thought; he turned\n" +
        "to me and whispered:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dont flatter yourself; Auddy is not nearly as entranced with the\n" +
        "scenery as he is with the prospect of leaving us long enough to\n" +
        "have a cigaret.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was shocked. Sir, I said in an undertone, please do not break\n" +
        "our harmony by these unpleasant words. I can hardly believe that\n" +
        "Auddy is hankering for a smoke. I looked apprehensively\n" +
        "at my usually irrepressible guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Very well; I wont say anything to Auddy. Master chuckled. But\n" +
        "you will soon see, when the landau halts, that Auddy is quick to\n" +
        "seize his opportunity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The carriage arrived at a small caravanserai. As our horses were led\n" +
        "to be watered, Auddy inquired, Sir, do you mind if I ride awhile\n" +
        "with the driver? I would like to get a little outside air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, He wants fresh\n" +
        "smoke and not fresh air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads. Masters\n" +
        "eyes were twinkling; he instructed me, Crane up your neck through\n" +
        "the carriage door and see what Auddy is doing with the air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I obeyed, and was astounded to observe Auddy in the act of exhaling\n" +
        "rings of cigaret smoke. My glance toward Sri Yukteswar was apologetic.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are right, as always, sir. Auddy is enjoying a puff along with\n" +
        "a panorama. I surmised that my friend had received a gift from the\n" +
        "cab driver; I knew Auddy had not carried any cigarets from Calcutta.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We continued on the labyrinthine way, adorned by views of rivers,\n" +
        "valleys, precipitous crags, and multitudinous mountain tiers.\n" +
        "Every night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food.\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar took special care of my diet, insisting that I have\n" +
        "lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily improving,\n" +
        "though the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Joyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir,\n" +
        "paradise land of lotus lakes, floating gardens, gaily canopied\n" +
        "houseboats, the many-bridged Jhelum River, and flower-strewn\n" +
        "pastures, all ringed round by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach\n" +
        "to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees. We\n" +
        "engaged rooms at a double-storied inn overlooking the noble hills.\n" +
        "No running water was available; we drew our supply from a near-by\n" +
        "well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm days and slightly\n" +
        "cold nights.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We made a pilgrimage to the ancient Srinagar temple of Swami\n" +
        "Shankara. As I gazed upon the mountain-peak hermitage, standing\n" +
        "bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision\n" +
        "appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara\n" +
        "ashram before me was transformed into the structure where, years\n" +
        "later, I established the Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters\n" +
        "in America. When I first visited Los Angeles, and saw the large\n" +
        "building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once\n" +
        "from my long-past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A few days at Srinagar; then on to Gulmarg (mountain paths of\n" +
        "flowers), elevated by six thousand feet. There I had my first ride\n" +
        "on a large horse. Rajendra mounted a small trotter, whose heart\n" +
        "was fired with ambition for speed. We ventured onto the very steep\n" +
        "Khilanmarg; the path led through a dense forest, abounding in\n" +
        "tree-mushrooms, where the mist-shrouded trails were often precarious.\n" +
        "But Rajendras little animal never permitted my oversized steed a\n" +
        "moments rest, even at the most perilous turns. On, on, untiringly\n" +
        "came Rajendras horse, oblivious to all but the joy of competition.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our strenuous race was rewarded by a breath-taking view. For\n" +
        "the first time in this life, I gazed in all directions at sublime\n" +
        "snow-capped Himalayas, lying tier upon tier like silhouettes of\n" +
        "huge polar bears. My eyes feasted exultingly on endless reaches\n" +
        "of icy mountains against sunny blue skies.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I rolled merrily with my young companions, all wearing overcoats,\n" +
        "on the sparkling white slopes. On our downward trip we saw afar a\n" +
        "vast carpet of yellow flowers, wholly transfiguring the bleak hills.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our next excursions were to the famous royal pleasure gardens\n" +
        "of the Emperor Jehangir, at Shalimar and Nishat Bagh. The ancient\n" +
        "palace at Nishat Bagh is built directly over a natural waterfall.\n" +
        "Rushing down from the mountains, the torrent has been regulated\n" +
        "through ingenious contrivances to flow over colorful terraces and\n" +
        "to gush into fountains amidst the dazzling flower-beds. The stream\n" +
        "also enters several of the palace rooms, ultimately dropping fairy\n" +
        "like into the lake below. The immense gardens are riotous with\n" +
        "color--roses of a dozen hues, snapdragons, lavender, pansies,\n" +
        "poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is given by symmetrical rows\n" +
        "of CHINARS, cypresses, cherry trees; beyond them tower\n" +
        "the white austerities of the Himalayas.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kashmir grapes are considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta. Rajendra,\n" +
        "who had been promising himself a veritable feast on reaching Kashmir,\n" +
        "was disappointed to find there no large vineyards. Now and then I\n" +
        "chaffed him jocosely over his baseless anticipation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Oh, I have become so much gorged with grapes I cant walk! I\n" +
        "would say. The invisible grapes are brewing within me! Later I\n" +
        "heard that sweet grapes grow abundantly in Kabul, west of Kashmir.\n" +
        "We consoled ourselves with ice cream made of RABRI, a heavily\n" +
        "condensed milk, and flavored with whole pistachio nuts.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We took several trips in the SHIKARAS or houseboats, shaded by\n" +
        "red-embroidered canopies, coursing along the intricate channels of\n" +
        "Dal Lake, a network of canals like a watery spider web. Here the\n" +
        "numerous floating gardens, crudely improvised with logs and earth,\n" +
        "strike one with amazement, so incongruous is the first sight of\n" +
        "vegetables and melons growing in the midst of vast waters. Occasionally\n" +
        "one sees a peasant, disdaining to be rooted to the soil, towing\n" +
        "his square plot of land to a new location in the many-fingered\n" +
        "lake.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In this storied vale one finds an epitome of all the earths\n" +
        "beauties. The Lady of Kashmir is mountain-crowned, lake-garlanded,\n" +
        "and flower-shod. In later years, after I had toured many distant\n" +
        "lands, I understood why Kashmir is often called the worlds most\n" +
        "scenic spot. It possesses some of the charms of the Swiss Alps,\n" +
        "and of Loch Lomond in Scotland, and of the exquisite English lakes.\n" +
        "An American traveler in Kashmir finds much to remind him of the\n" +
        "rugged grandeur of Alaska and of Pikes Peak near Denver.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As entries in a scenic beauty contest, I offer for first prize\n" +
        "either the gorgeous view of Xochimilco in Mexico, where mountains,\n" +
        "skies, and poplars reflect themselves in myriad lanes of water amidst\n" +
        "the playful fish, or the jewel-like lakes of Kashmir, guarded like\n" +
        "beautiful maidens by the stern surveillance of the Himalayas. These\n" +
        "two places stand out in my memory as the loveliest spots on earth.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yet I was awed also when I first beheld the wonders of Yellowstone\n" +
        "National Park and of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and of\n" +
        "Alaska. Yellowstone Park is perhaps the only region where one can\n" +
        "see innumerable geysers shooting high into the air, performing year\n" +
        "after year with clockwork regularity. Its opal and sapphire pools\n" +
        "and hot sulphurous springs, its bears and wild creatures, remind\n" +
        "one that here Nature left a specimen of her earliest creation.\n" +
        "Motoring along the roads of Wyoming to the Devils Paint Pot of\n" +
        "hot bubbling mud, with gurgling springs, vaporous fountains, and\n" +
        "spouting geysers in all directions, I was disposed to say that\n" +

        "designed with skill divine. Though there are wonderful falls in\n" +
        "the Orient, none match the torrential beauty of Niagara near the\n" +
        "Canadian border. The Mammoth Caves of Kentucky and the Carlsbad\n" +
        "Caverns in New Mexico, with colorful iciclelike formations, are\n" +
        "stunning fairylands. Their long needles of stalactite spires,\n" +

        "they look like Americans. The cold Himalayas protect the Kashmiris\n" +
        "from the sultry sun and preserve their light complexions. As one\n" +

        "those difficult finals?\n" +
        "\n" +

        "examinations; answer them the best way you can.\n" +

        "say the least, belated.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will appear if you wish it, I said amidst sobs. But no time\n" +
        "remains for proper preparation. Under my breath I muttered, I will\n" +

        "\n" +
        "When I entered the hermitage the following day at my usual hour,\n" +
        "I presented my bouquet with a certain mournful solemnity. Sri\n" +

        "elsewhere?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, sir, I responded warmly. Grateful memories came in a revivifying\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Not laziness but burning zeal for God has prevented you from\n" +

        "were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course; I am at your service. He spent several hours of that\n" +

        "\n" +
        "I believe many questions in English literature will be centered\n" +

        "\n" +
        "A few classmates had gathered around to listen to the tutoring.\n" +
        "Romesh is advising you wrongly, one of them commented to me at\n" +
        "the end of a session. Usually only fifty per cent of the questions\n" +
        "are about the books; the other half will involve the authors\n" +
        "lives.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I sat for the examination in English literature the following\n" +
        "day, my first glance at the questions caused tears of gratitude\n" +
        "to pour forth, wetting my paper. The classroom monitor came to my\n" +
        "desk and made a sympathetic inquiry.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru foretold that Romesh would help me, I explained. Look;\n" +
        "the very questions dictated to me by Romesh are here on the examination\n" +
        "sheet! Fortunately for me, there are very few questions this year\n" +
        "on English authors, whose lives are wrapped in deep mystery so far\n" +
        "as I am concerned!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My boardinghouse was in an uproar when I returned. The boys who\n" +
        "had been ridiculing Romeshs method of coaching looked at me in\n" +
        "awe, almost deafening me with congratulations. During the week of\n" +
        "the examinations, I spent many hours with Romesh, who formulated\n" +
        "questions that he thought were likely to be set by the professors.\n" +
        "Day by day, Romeshs questions appeared in almost the same form on\n" +
        "the examination sheets.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The news was widely circulated in the college that something resembling\n" +
        "a miracle was occurring, and that success seemed probable for the\n" +
        "absent-minded Mad Monk. I made no attempt to hide the facts of the\n" +
        "case. The local professors were powerless to alter the questions,\n" +
        "which had been arranged by Calcutta University.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thinking over the examination in English literature, I realized\n" +
        "one morning that I had made a serious error. One section of the\n" +
        "questions had been divided into two parts of A or B, and C or D.\n" +
        "Instead of answering one question from each part, I had carelessly\n" +
        "answered both questions in Group I, and had failed to consider\n" +
        "anything in Group II. The best mark I could score in that paper\n" +
        "would be 33, three less than the passing mark of 36. I rushed to\n" +
        "Master and poured out my troubles.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunder. I dont deserve the\n" +
        "divine blessings through Romesh; I am quite unworthy.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Cheer up, Mukunda. Sri Yukteswars tones were light and unconcerned.\n" +
        "He pointed to the blue vault of the heavens. It is more possible\n" +
        "for the sun and moon to interchange their positions in space than\n" +

        "\n" +

        "twice apprehensively into the sky; the Lord of Day appeared to be\n" +
        "securely anchored in his customary orbit!\n" +
        "\n" +

        "\n" +

        "I questioned him eagerly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Long-haired monk, he said laughingly, why this sudden interest\n" +
        "in scholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour? But it is true\n" +
        "that the passing mark has just been lowered to 33 points.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A few joyous leaps took me into my own room, where I sank to my\n" +
        "knees and praised the mathematical perfections of my Divine Father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Every day I thrilled with the consciousness of a spiritual presence\n" +
        "that I clearly felt to be guiding me through Romesh. A significant\n" +
        "incident occurred in connection with the examination in Bengali.\n" +
        "Romesh, who had touched little on that subject, called me back\n" +
        "one morning as I was leaving the boardinghouse on my way to the\n" +
        "examination hall.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There is Romesh shouting for you, a classmate said to me impatiently.\n" +
        "Dont return; we shall be late at the hall.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ignoring the advice, I ran back to the house.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Bengali examination is usually easily passed by our Bengali\n" +
        "boys, Romesh told me. But I have just had a hunch that this\n" +
        "year the professors have planned to massacre the students by asking\n" +
        "questions from our ancient literature. My friend then briefly outlined\n" +
        "two stories from the life of Vidyasagar, a renowned philanthropist.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I thanked Romesh and quickly bicycled to the college hall.\n" +
        "The examination sheet in Bengali proved to contain two parts. The\n" +
        "first instruction was: Write two instances of the charities of\n" +
        "Vidyasagar. As I transferred to the paper the lore that I had so\n" +
        "recently acquired, I whispered a few words of thanksgiving that\n" +
        "I had heeded Romeshs last-minute summons. Had I been ignorant of\n" +
        "Vidyasagars benefactions to mankind (including ultimately myself),\n" +
        "I could not have passed the Bengali examination. Failing in one\n" +
        "subject, I would have been forced to stand examination anew in all\n" +
        "subjects the following year. Such a prospect was understandably\n" +
        "abhorrent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The second instruction on the sheet read: Write an essay in Bengali\n" +
        "on the life of the man who has most inspired you. Gentle reader,\n" +
        "I need not inform you what man I chose for my theme. As I covered\n" +
        "page after page with praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that\n" +
        "my muttered prediction was coming true: I will fill up the sheets\n" +
        "with your teachings!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in\n" +
        "philosophy. Trusting my long training under Sri Yukteswar, I safely\n" +
        "disregarded the textbook explanations. The highest mark given to\n" +
        "any of my papers was the one in philosophy. My score in all other\n" +
        "subjects was just barely within the passing mark.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "reflecting that it was a divine gift, conferred on me for reasons\n" +
        "somewhat obscure. Occasionally I hear college men remark that\n" +
        "very little of their crammed knowledge remained with them after\n" +

        "the life force from the heart and brings it under his control.\n" +
        " The interpretation is: The yogi arrests decay in the body\n" +
        "by an addition of life force, and arrests the mutations of growth\n" +
        "in the body by APAN (eliminating current). Thus neutralizing decay\n" +

        "staying. Pranabanandas prediction, made to me so many years before,\n" +
        "came rushing to my mind: I shall see you, with your father, later\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Bhagabati, he said, what are you doing about yourself? Dont you\n" +
        "see your son racing to the Infinite? I blushed to hear his praise\n" +
        "before my father. The swami went on, You recall how often our\n" +
        "blessed guru used to say: BANAT, BANAT, BAN JAI. So keep\n" +
        "up KRIYA YOGA ceaselessly, and reach the divine portals quickly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The body of Pranabananda, which had appeared so well and strong\n" +
        "during my amazing first visit to him in Benares, now showed definite\n" +
        "aging, though his posture was still admirably erect.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swamiji, I inquired, looking straight into his eyes, please tell\n" +
        "me the truth: Arent you feeling the advance of age? As the body\n" +
        "is weakening, are your perceptions of God suffering any diminution?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He smiled angelically. The Beloved is more than ever with me now.\n" +
        "His complete conviction overwhelmed my mind and soul. He went on,\n" +
        "I am still enjoying the two pensions-one from Bhagabati here, and\n" +
        "one from above. Pointing his finger heavenward, the saint fell\n" +
        "into an ecstasy, his face lit with a divine glow-an ample answer\n" +
        "to my question.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Noticing that Pranabanandas room contained many plants and packages\n" +
        "of seed, I asked their purpose.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have left Benares permanently, he said, and am now on my way\n" +
        "to the Himalayas. There I shall open an ashram for my disciples.\n" +
        "These seeds will produce spinach and a few other vegetables. My dear\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Never again, the saint replied. This year is the one in which\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya told me I would leave my beloved Benares forever\n" +
        "and go to the Himalayas, there to throw off my mortal frame.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My eyes filled with tears at his words, but the swami smiled\n" +
        "tranquilly. He reminded me of a little heavenly child, sitting\n" +
        "securely on the lap of the Divine Mother. The burden of the years\n" +
        "has no ill effect on a great yogis full possession of supreme\n" +
        "spiritual powers. He is able to renew his body at will; yet sometimes\n" +
        "he does not care to retard the aging process, but allows his karma\n" +
        "to work itself out on the physical plane, using his old body as a\n" +
        "time-saving device to exclude the necessity of working out karma\n" +
        "in a new incarnation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +

        "Pranabanandas close disciples.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My adorable guru is gone, he told me, amidst sobs. He established\n" +
        "a hermitage near Rishikesh, and gave us loving training. When we\n" +
        "were pretty well settled, and making rapid spiritual progress in his\n" +
        "company, he proposed one day to feed a huge crowd from Rishikesh.\n" +
        "I inquired why he wanted such a large number.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This is my last festival ceremony, he said. I did not understand\n" +
        "the full implications of his words.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Pranabanandaji helped with the cooking of great amounts of food.\n" +
        "We fed about 2000 guests. After the feast, he sat on a high platform\n" +
        "and gave an inspired sermon on the Infinite. At the end, before\n" +
        "the gaze of thousands, he turned to me, as I sat beside him on the\n" +
        "dais, and spoke with unusual force.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sanandan, be prepared; I am going to kick the frame. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "After a stunned silence, I cried loudly, Master, dont do it!\n" +
        "Please, please, dont do it! The crowd was tongue-tied, watching\n" +
        "us curiously. My guru smiled at me, but his solemn gaze was already\n" +
        "fixed on Eternity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be not selfish, he said, nor grieve for me. I have been long\n" +
        "cheerfully serving you all; now rejoice and wish me Godspeed. I\n" +
        "go to meet my Cosmic Beloved. In a whisper, Pranabanandaji added,\n" +
        "I shall be reborn shortly. After enjoying a short period of the\n" +
        "Infinite Bliss, I shall return to earth and join Babaji. \n" +
        "You shall soon know when and where my soul has been encased in a\n" +
        "new body.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He cried again, Sanandan, here I kick the frame by the second\n" +
        "KRIYA YOGA. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "He looked at the sea of faces before us, and gave a blessing.\n" +
        "Directing his gaze inwardly to the spiritual eye, he became immobile.\n" +
        "While the bewildered crowd thought he was meditating in an ecstatic\n" +
        "state, he had already left the tabernacle of flesh and plunged\n" +
        "his soul into the cosmic vastness. The disciples touched his body,\n" +
        "seated in the lotus posture, but it was no longer the warm flesh.\n" +
        "Only a stiffened frame remained; the tenant had fled to the immortal\n" +
        "shore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I inquired where Pranabananda was to be reborn.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thats a sacred trust I cannot divulge to anyone, Sanandan replied.\n" +
        "Perhaps you may find out some other way.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years later I discovered from Swami Keshabananda that\n" +
        "Pranabananda, a few years after his birth in a new body, had gone\n" +
        "to Badrinarayan in the Himalayas, and there joined the group of\n" +
        "saints around the great Babaji.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please do not go into the water. Let us bathe by dipping our\n" +
        "buckets.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was addressing the young Ranchi students who were accompanying\n" +
        "me on an eight-mile hike to a neighboring hill. The pond before\n" +
        "us was inviting, but a distaste for it had arisen in my mind. The\n" +
        "group around me followed my example of dipping buckets, but a few\n" +
        "lads yielded to the temptation of the cool waters. No sooner had\n" +
        "they dived than large water snakes wiggled around them. The boys\n" +
        "came out of the pond with comical alacrity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We enjoyed a picnic lunch after we reached our destination. I sat\n" +
        "under a tree, surrounded by a group of students. Finding me in an\n" +
        "inspirational mood, they plied me with questions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please tell me, sir, one youth inquired, if I shall always stay\n" +
        "with you in the path of renunciation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ah, no, I replied, you will be forcibly taken away to your home,\n" +
        "and later you will marry.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Incredulous, he made a vehement protest. Only if I am dead can I\n" +
        "be carried home. But in a few months, his parents arrived to take\n" +
        "him away, in spite of his tearful resistance; some years later, he\n" +
        "did marry.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After answering many questions, I was addressed by a lad named\n" +
        "Kashi. He was about twelve years old, a brilliant student, and\n" +
        "beloved by all.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, he said, what will be my fate?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You shall soon be dead. The reply came from my lips with an\n" +
        "irresistible force.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This unexpected disclosure shocked and grieved me as well as\n" +
        "everyone present. Silently rebuking myself as an ENFANT TERRIBLE,\n" +
        "I refused to answer further questions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On our return to the school, Kashi came to my room.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If I die, will you find me when I am reborn, and bring me again\n" +
        "to the spiritual path? He sobbed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility.\n" +
        "But for weeks afterward, Kashi pressed me doggedly. Seeing him\n" +
        "unnerved to the breaking point, I finally consoled him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, I promised. If the Heavenly Father lends His aid, I will\n" +
        "try to find you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "During the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting\n" +
        "that I could not take Kashi with me, I called him to my room\n" +
        "before leaving, and carefully instructed him to remain, against\n" +
        "all persuasion, in the spiritual vibrations of the school. Somehow\n" +
        "I felt that if he did not go home, he might avoid the impending\n" +
        "calamity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No sooner had I left than Kashis father arrived in Ranchi. For\n" +
        "fifteen days he tried to break the will of his son, explaining that\n" +
        "if Kashi would go to Calcutta for only four days to see his mother,\n" +
        "he could then return. Kashi persistently refused. The father finally\n" +
        "said he would take the boy away with the help of the police. The\n" +
        "threat disturbed Kashi, who was unwilling to be the cause of any\n" +
        "unfavorable publicity to the school. He saw no choice but to go.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I returned to Ranchi a few days later. When I heard how Kashi had\n" +
        "been removed, I entrained at once for Calcutta. There I engaged a\n" +
        "horse cab. Very strangely, as the vehicle passed beyond the Howrah\n" +
        "bridge over the Ganges, I beheld Kashis father and other relatives\n" +
        "in mourning clothes. Shouting to my driver to stop, I rushed out\n" +
        "and glared at the unfortunate father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mr Murderer, I cried somewhat unreasonably, you have killed my\n" +
        "boy!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The father had already realized the wrong he had done in forcibly\n" +
        "bringing Kashi to Calcutta. During the few days the boy had been\n" +
        "there, he had eaten contaminated food, contracted cholera, and\n" +
        "passed on.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My love for Kashi, and the pledge to find him after death, night and\n" +
        "day haunted me. No matter where I went, his face loomed up before\n" +
        "me. I began a memorable search for him, even as long ago I had\n" +
        "searched for my lost mother.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I felt that inasmuch as God had given me the faculty of reason, I\n" +
        "must utilize it and tax my powers to the utmost in order to discover\n" +
        "the subtle laws by which I could know the boys astral whereabouts.\n" +
        "He was a soul vibrating with unfulfilled desires, I realized-a mass\n" +
        "of light floating somewhere amidst millions of luminous souls in\n" +
        "the astral regions. How was I to tune in with him, among so many\n" +
        "vibrating lights of other souls?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Using a secret yoga technique, I broadcasted my love to Kashis\n" +
        "soul through the microphone of the spiritual eye, the inner point\n" +
        "between the eyebrows. With the antenna of upraised hands and\n" +
        "fingers, I often turned myself round and round, trying to locate\n" +
        "the direction in which he had been reborn as an embryo. I hoped to\n" +
        "receive response from him in the concentration-tuned radio of my\n" +
        "heart. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "I intuitively felt that Kashi would soon return to the earth, and\n" +
        "that if I kept unceasingly broadcasting my call to him, his soul\n" +
        "would reply. I knew that the slightest impulse sent by Kashi would\n" +
        "be felt in my fingers, hands, arms, spine, and nerves.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With undiminished zeal, I practiced the yoga method steadily for\n" +
        "about six months after Kashis death. Walking with a few friends\n" +
        "one morning in the crowded Bowbazar section of Calcutta, I lifted\n" +
        "my hands in the usual manner. For the first time, there was response.\n" +
        "I thrilled to detect electrical impulses trickling down my fingers\n" +
        "and palms. These currents translated themselves into one overpowering\n" +
        "thought from a deep recess of my consciousness: I am Kashi; I am\n" +
        "Kashi; come to me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The thought became almost audible as I concentrated on my heart\n" +
        "radio. In the characteristic, slightly hoarse whisper of Kashi,\n" +
        " I heard his summons again and again. I seized the arm\n" +
        "of one of my companions, Prokash Das, and smiled at him\n" +
        "joyfully.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It looks as though I have located Kashi!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I began to turn round and round, to the undisguised amusement of\n" +
        "my friends and the passing throng. The electrical impulses tingled\n" +
        "through my fingers only when I faced toward a near-by path, aptly\n" +
        "named Serpentine Lane. The astral currents disappeared when I\n" +
        "turned in other directions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ah, I exclaimed, Kashis soul must be living in the womb of some\n" +
        "mother whose home is in this lane.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My companions and I approached closer to Serpentine Lane; the\n" +
        "vibrations in my upraised hands grew stronger, more pronounced.\n" +
        "As if by a magnet, I was pulled toward the right side of the road.\n" +
        "Reaching the entrance of a certain house, I was astounded to find\n" +
        "myself transfixed. I knocked at the door in a state of intense\n" +
        "excitement, holding my very breath. I felt that the successful end\n" +
        "had come for my long, arduous, and certainly unusual quest!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The door was opened by a servant, who told me her master was at\n" +
        "home. He descended the stairway from the second floor and smiled\n" +
        "at me inquiringly. I hardly knew how to frame my question, at once\n" +
        "pertinent and impertinent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please tell me, sir, if you and your wife have been expecting a\n" +
        "child for about six months?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, it is so. Seeing that I was a swami, a renunciate attired\n" +
        "in the traditional orange cloth, he added politely, Pray inform\n" +
        "me how you know my affairs.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When he heard about Kashi and the promise I had given, the astonished\n" +
        "man believed my story.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A male child of fair complexion will be born to you, I told him.\n" +
        "He will have a broad face, with a cowlick atop his forehead. His\n" +
        "disposition will be notably spiritual. I felt certain that the\n" +
        "coming child would bear these resemblances to Kashi.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Later I visited the child, whose parents had given him his old name\n" +
        "of Kashi. Even in infancy he was strikingly similar in appearance\n" +
        "to my dear Ranchi student. The child showed me an instantaneous\n" +
        "affection; the attraction of the past awoke with redoubled intensity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years later the teen-age boy wrote me, during my stay in America.\n" +
        "He explained his deep longing to follow the path of a renunciate.\n" +
        "I directed him to a Himalayan master who, to this day, guides the\n" +
        "reborn Kashi.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rabindranath Tagore taught us to sing, as a natural form of\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Bhola Nath, a bright fourteen-year-old lad at my Ranchi school,\n" +

        "on his melodious outbursts. With or without provocation, the boy\n" +
        "poured forth a tuneful stream. He had previously attended the famous\n" +

        "\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Bhola curiously inquired the story.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The scholars severely flayed Tagore for introducing a new style\n" +
        "into Bengali poetry, I began. He mixed colloquial and classical\n" +
        "expressions, ignoring all the prescribed limitations dear to\n" +
        "the pundits hearts. His songs embody deep philosophic truth in\n" +
        "emotionally appealing terms, with little regard for the accepted\n" +
        "literary forms.\n" +

        "as a pigeon-poet who sold his cooings in print for a rupee. But\n" +

        "at his feet soon after he had translated into English his GITANJALI\n" +
        "(Song Offerings). A trainload of pundits, including his one-time\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Rabindranath received his guests only after an intentionally long\n" +

        "\n" +

        "by his secretary, Mr C. F. Andrews, who was simply attired\n" +
        "in a Bengali DHOTI. He referred lovingly to Tagore as his GURUDEVA.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rabindranath received me graciously. He emanated a soothing aura\n" +
        "of charm, culture, and courtliness. Replying to my question about\n" +

        "days together he would sit on top of the water, or remain hidden\n" +
        "for very long periods under the waves. A common sight at the Benares\n" +
        "bathing GHATS was the swamis motionless body on the blistering\n" +
        "stone slabs, wholly exposed to the merciless Indian sun. By these\n" +
        "feats Trailanga sought to teach men that a yogis life does not\n" +

        "he were above water or under it, and whether or not his body lay\n" +

        "by divine consciousness: death could not touch him.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "unconscious of his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of\n" +
        "it, however, and unceremoniously committed him to jail. General\n" +
        "embarrassment ensued; the enormous body of Trailanga was soon seen,\n" +
        "in its usual entirety, on the prison roof. His cell, still securely\n" +

        "occasionally. After weeks without food, he would break his fast\n" +
        "with potfuls of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic\n" +
        "once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket\n" +

        "one with your own. Except for my knowledge that God is present in\n" +
        "my stomach, as in every atom of creation, the lime would have killed\n" +

        "which upholds creations farthest swinging orb. Men of God-realization\n" +

        "That there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise\n" +
        "us. The great guru has never openly appeared in any century; the\n" +
        "misinterpreting glare of publicity has no place in his millennial\n" +
        "plans. Like the Creator, the sole but silent Power, Babaji works\n" +

        "Great prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific\n" +

        "with the slow evolutionary progress of man during the centuries\n" +
        "than with any one outstanding event of history. Such masters always\n" +
        "veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power\n" +
        "to become invisible at will. For these reasons, and because they\n" +
        "generally instruct their disciples to maintain silence about them, a\n" +
        "number of towering spiritual figures remain world-unknown. I give\n" +
        "in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his life-only a few facts\n" +
        "which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No limiting facts about Babajis family or birthplace, dear to the\n" +
        "annalists heart, have ever been discovered. His speech is generally\n" +
        "in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted\n" +
        "the simple name of Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect\n" +
        "given him by Lahiri Mahasayas disciples are Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj\n" +
        "(supreme ecstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak\n" +
        "Baba and Shiva Baba (titles of avatars of Shiva). Does it matter\n" +
        "that we know not the patronymic of an earth-released master?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Whenever anyone utters with reverence the name of Babaji, Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya said, that devotee attracts an instant spiritual blessing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to\n" +
        "be no more than a youth of twenty-five. Fair-skinned, of medium build\n" +
        "and height, Babajis beautiful, strong body radiates a perceptible\n" +
        "glow. His eyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous\n" +
        "hair is copper-colored. A very strange fact is that Babaji bears an\n" +
        "extraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya.\n" +
        "The similarity is so striking that, in his later years, Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya might have passed as the father of the youthful-looking\n" +
        "Babaji.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swami Kebalananda, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some time with\n" +
        "Babaji in the Himalayas.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The peerless master moves with his group from place to place in\n" +
        "the mountains, Kebalananda told me. His small band contains two\n" +
        "highly advanced American disciples. After Babaji has been in one\n" +
        "locality for some time, he says: DERA DANDA UTHAO. (Let us lift\n" +
        "our camp and staff). He carries a symbolic DANDA (bamboo staff).\n" +
        "His words are the signal for moving with his group instantaneously\n" +
        "to another place. He does not always employ this method of astral\n" +
        "travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji can be seen or recognized by others only when he so\n" +
        "desires. He is known to have appeared in many slightly different\n" +
        "forms to various devotees-sometimes without beard and moustache,\n" +
        "and sometimes with them. As his undecaying body requires no food,\n" +
        "the master seldom eats. As a social courtesy to visiting disciples,\n" +
        "he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk and clarified\n" +
        "butter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Two amazing incidents of Babajis life are known to me, Kebalananda\n" +
        "went on. His disciples were sitting one night around a huge fire\n" +
        "which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master suddenly\n" +
        "seized a burning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a\n" +
        "chela who was close to the fire.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, how cruel! Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, made this\n" +
        "remonstrance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes,\n" +
        "according to the decree of his past karma?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With these words Babaji placed his healing hand on the chelas\n" +
        "disfigured shoulder. I have freed you tonight from painful death.\n" +
        "The karmic law has been satisfied through your slight suffering by\n" +
        "fire.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On another occasion Babajis sacred circle was disturbed by the\n" +
        "arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with astonishing skill to\n" +
        "the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, you must be the great Babaji. The mans face was lit with\n" +
        "inexpressible reverence. For months I have pursued a ceaseless\n" +
        "search for you among these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept\n" +
        "me as a disciple.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky\n" +
        "chasm at his feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no\n" +
        "further value if I cannot win your guidance to the Divine.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jump then, Babaji said unemotionally. I cannot accept you in\n" +
        "your present state of development.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed\n" +
        "the shocked disciples to fetch the strangers body. When they\n" +
        "returned with the mangled form, the master placed his divine hand\n" +
        "on the dead man. Lo! he opened his eyes and prostrated himself\n" +
        "humbly before the omnipotent one.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You are now ready for discipleship. Babaji beamed lovingly on\n" +
        "his resurrected chela. You have courageously passed a difficult\n" +
        "test. Death shall not touch you again; now you are one of our\n" +
        "immortal flock. Then he spoke his usual words of departure, DERA\n" +
        "DANDA UTHAO; the whole group vanished from the mountain.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no\n" +
        "distance inverse to the square. Only one reason, therefore, can\n" +
        "motivate Babaji in maintaining his physical form from century to\n" +
        "century: the desire to furnish humanity with a concrete example\n" +
        "of its own possibilities. Were man never vouchsafed a glimpse of\n" +
        "Divinity in the flesh, he would remain oppressed by the heavy mayic\n" +
        "delusion that he cannot transcend his mortality.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jesus knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed\n" +
        "through each event not for himself, not from any karmic compulsion,\n" +
        "but solely for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His\n" +
        "four reporter-disciples-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-recorded the\n" +
        "ineffable drama for the benefit of later generations.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "For Babaji, also, there is no relativity of past, present, future;\n" +
        "from the beginning he has known all phases of his life. Yet,\n" +
        "accommodating himself to the limited understanding of men, he has\n" +
        "played many acts of his divine life in the presence of one or more\n" +
        "witnesses. Thus it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya was\n" +
        "present when Babaji deemed the time to be ripe for him to proclaim\n" +
        "the possibility of bodily immortality. He uttered this promise\n" +
        "before Ram Gopal Muzumdar, that it might finally become known for\n" +
        "the inspiration of other seeking hearts. The great ones speak their\n" +
        "words and participate in the seemingly natural course of events,\n" +
        "solely for the good of man, even as Christ said: Father I\n" +
        "knew that thou hearest me always: but BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHICH\n" +
        "STAND BY I SAID IT, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.\n" +
        " During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, the sleepless\n" +
        "saint, he related the wondrous story of his first meeting\n" +
        "with Babaji.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I sometimes left my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasayas feet\n" +
        "in Benares, Ram Gopal told me. One midnight as I was silently\n" +
        "meditating in a group of his disciples, the master made a surprising\n" +
        "request.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ram Gopal, he said, go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing GHAT.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I soon reached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight\n" +
        "and the glittering stars. After I had sat in patient silence for\n" +
        "awhile, my attention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet.\n" +
        "It rose gradually, revealing an underground cave. As the stone\n" +
        "remained balanced in some unknown manner, the draped form of\n" +
        "a young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from the cave\n" +
        "high into the air. Surrounded by a soft halo, she slowly descended\n" +
        "in front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner state of\n" +
        "ecstasy. She finally stirred, and spoke gently.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am Mataji, the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and\n" +
        "also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave tonight to discuss a matter\n" +
        "of great importance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A nebulous light was rapidly floating over the Ganges; the strange\n" +
        "luminescence was reflected in the opaque waters. It approached\n" +
        "nearer and nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the\n" +
        "side of Mataji and condensed itself instantly into the human form\n" +
        "of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the woman saint.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further\n" +
        "wonderstruck to behold a circling mass of mystical light traveling\n" +
        "in the sky. Descending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our\n" +
        "group and materialized itself into the body of a beautiful youth who,\n" +
        "I understood at once, was Babaji. He looked like Lahiri Mahasaya,\n" +
        "the only difference being that Babaji appeared much younger, and\n" +
        "had long, bright hair.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, and myself knelt at the gurus feet. An\n" +
        "ethereal sensation of beatific glory thrilled every fiber of my\n" +
        "being as I touched his divine flesh.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Blessed sister, Babaji said, I am intending to shed my form\n" +
        "and plunge into the Infinite Current.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I wanted to\n" +
        "discuss it with you tonight. Why should you leave your body? The\n" +
        "glorious woman looked at him beseechingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What is the difference if I wear a visible or invisible wave on\n" +
        "the ocean of my Spirit?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mataji replied with a quaint flash of wit. Deathless guru, if it\n" +
        "makes no difference, then please do not ever relinquish your form.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be it so, Babaji said solemnly. I will never leave my physical\n" +
        "body. It will always remain visible to at least a small number of\n" +
        "people on this earth. The Lord has spoken His own wish through your\n" +
        "lips.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I listened in awe to the conversation between these exalted\n" +
        "beings, the great guru turned to me with a benign gesture.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Fear not, Ram Gopal, he said, you are blessed to be a witness\n" +
        "at the scene of this immortal promise.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the sweet melody of Babajis voice faded away, his form and\n" +
        "that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated and moved backward over\n" +
        "the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling light templed their bodies as\n" +
        "they vanished into the night sky. Matajis form floated to the cave\n" +
        "and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on\n" +
        "an invisible leverage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Infinitely inspired, I wended my way back to Lahiri Mahasayas\n" +
        "place. As I bowed before him in the early dawn, my guru smiled at\n" +
        "me understandingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am happy for you, Ram Gopal, he said. The desire of meeting\n" +
        "Babaji and Mataji, which you have often expressed to me, has found\n" +
        "at last a sacred fulfillment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My fellow disciples informed me that Lahiri Mahasaya had not moved\n" +
        "from his dais since early the preceding evening.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He gave a wonderful discourse on immortality after you had left\n" +
        "for the Dasasamedh GHAT, one of the chelas told me. For the first\n" +
        "time I fully realized the truth in the scriptural verses which state\n" +
        "that a man of self-realization can appear at different places in\n" +
        "two or more bodies at the same time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me many metaphysical points\n" +
        "concerning the hidden divine plan for this earth, Ram Gopal\n" +
        "concluded. Babaji has been chosen by God to remain in his body\n" +
        "for the duration of this particular world cycle. Ages shall come\n" +
        "and go--still the deathless master, beholding the drama\n" +
        "of the centuries, shall be present on this stage terrestrial.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babajis first meeting with Lahiri Mahasaya is an enthralling\n" +
        "story, and one of the few which gives us a detailed glimpse of the\n" +
        "deathless guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "These words were Swami Kebalanandas preamble to a wondrous tale.\n" +
        "The first time he recounted it I was literally spellbound. On many\n" +
        "other occasions I coaxed my gentle Sanskrit tutor to repeat the\n" +
        "story, which was later told me in substantially the same words by\n" +
        "Sri Yukteswar. Both these Lahiri Mahasaya disciples had heard the\n" +
        "awesome tale direct from the lips of their guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My first meeting with Babaji took place in my thirty-third year,\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasaya had said. In the autumn of 1861 I was stationed\n" +
        "in Danapur as a government accountant in the Military Engineering\n" +
        "Department. One morning the office manager summoned me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, he said, a telegram has just come from our main office.\n" +
        "You are to be transferred to Ranikhet, where an army post \n" +
        "is now being established.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With one servant, I set out on the 500-mile trip. Traveling by\n" +
        "horse and buggy, we arrived in thirty days at the Himalayan site\n" +
        "of Ranikhet. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "My office duties were not onerous; I was able to spend many hours\n" +
        "roaming in the magnificent hills. A rumor reached me that great saints\n" +
        "blessed the region with their presence; I felt a strong desire to\n" +
        "see them. During a ramble one early afternoon, I was astounded to\n" +
        "hear a distant voice calling my name. I continued my vigorous upward\n" +
        "climb on Drongiri Mountain. A slight uneasiness beset me at the\n" +
        "thought that I might not be able to retrace my steps before darkness\n" +
        "had descended over the jungle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I finally reached a small clearing whose sides were dotted\n" +
        "with caves. On one of the rocky ledges stood a smiling young man,\n" +
        "extending his hand in welcome. I noticed with astonishment that,\n" +
        "except for his copper-colored hair, he bore a remarkable resemblance\n" +
        "to myself.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, you have come! The saint addressed me affectionately in\n" +
        "Hindi. Rest here in this cave. It was I who called you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I entered a neat little grotto which contained several woolen\n" +
        "blankets and a few KAMANDULUS (begging bowls).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, do you remember that seat? The yogi pointed to a folded\n" +
        "blanket in one corner.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, sir. Somewhat dazed at the strangeness of my adventure, I\n" +
        "added, I must leave now, before nightfall. I have business in the\n" +
        "morning at my office.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The mysterious saint replied in English, The office was brought\n" +
        "for you, and not you for the office.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was dumbfounded that this forest ascetic should not only speak\n" +
        "English but also paraphrase the words of Christ. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see my telegram took effect. The yogis remark was incomprehensible\n" +
        "to me; I inquired his meaning.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I refer to the telegram that summoned you to these isolated parts.\n" +
        "It was I who silently suggested to the mind of your superior officer\n" +
        "that you be transferred to Ranikhet. When one feels his unity with\n" +
        "mankind, all minds become transmitting stations through which he\n" +
        "can work at will. He added gently, Lahiri, surely this cave seems\n" +
        "familiar to you?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I maintained a bewildered silence, the saint approached and\n" +
        "struck me gently on the forehead. At his magnetic touch, a wondrous\n" +
        "current swept through my brain, releasing the sweet seed-memories\n" +
        "of my previous life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I remember! My voice was half-choked with joyous sobs. You are\n" +
        "my guru Babaji, who has belonged to me always! Scenes of the past\n" +
        "arise vividly in my mind; here in this cave I spent many years of\n" +
        "my last incarnation! As ineffable recollections overwhelmed me,\n" +
        "I tearfully embraced my masters feet.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "For more than three decades I have waited for you here-waited\n" +
        "for you to return to me! Babajis voice rang with celestial love.\n" +
        "You slipped away and vanished into the tumultuous waves of the life\n" +
        "beyond death. The magic wand of your karma touched you, and you\n" +
        "were gone! Though you lost sight of me, never did I lose sight\n" +
        "of you! I pursued you over the luminescent astral sea where the\n" +
        "glorious angels sail. Through gloom, storm, upheaval, and light I\n" +
        "followed you, like a mother bird guarding her young. As you lived\n" +
        "out your human term of womb-life, and emerged a babe, my eye was\n" +
        "ever on you. When you covered your tiny form in the lotus posture\n" +
        "under the Nadia sands in your childhood, I was invisibly present!\n" +
        "Patiently, month after month, year after year, I have watched over\n" +
        "you, waiting for this perfect day. Now you are with me! Lo, here\n" +
        "is your cave, loved of yore! I have kept it ever clean and ready\n" +
        "for you. Here is your hallowed ASANA-blanket, where you daily sat\n" +
        "to fill your expanding heart with God! Behold there your bowl, from\n" +
        "which you often drank the nectar prepared by me! See how I have\n" +
        "kept the brass cup brightly polished, that you might drink again\n" +
        "therefrom! My own, do you now understand?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My guru, what can I say? I murmured brokenly. Where has one\n" +
        "ever heard of such deathless love? I gazed long and ecstatically\n" +
        "on my eternal treasure, my guru in life and death.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, you need purification. Drink the oil in this bowl and lie\n" +
        "down by the river. Babajis practical wisdom, I reflected with a\n" +
        "quick, reminiscent smile, was ever to the fore.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Bitter winds whipped around me in the darkness, shrieking a fierce\n" +

        "then over my body, outstretched on the rocky bank. Tigers howled\n" +
        "near-by, but my heart was free of fear; the radiant force newly\n" +

        "peerless Babaji. In the dim past, you once expressed a desire to\n" +
        "enjoy the beauties of a palace. Our master is now satisfying your\n" +
        "wish, thus freeing you from the bonds of karma. He added,\n" +
        "The magnificent palace will be the scene of your initiation tonight\n" +
        "into KRIYA YOGA. All your brothers here join in a paean of welcome,\n" +
        "rejoicing at the end of your long exile. Behold!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A vast palace of dazzling gold stood before us. Studded with\n" +
        "countless jewels, and set amidst landscaped gardens, it presented\n" +
        "a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur. Saints of angelic countenance\n" +
        "were stationed by resplendent gates, half-reddened by the glitter\n" +
        "of rubies. Diamonds, pearls, sapphires, and emeralds of great size\n" +
        "and luster were imbedded in the decorative arches.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I followed my companion into a spacious reception hall. The odor\n" +
        "of incense and of roses wafted through the air; dim lamps shed\n" +
        "a multicolored glow. Small groups of devotees, some fair, some\n" +
        "dark-skinned, chanted musically, or sat in the meditative posture,\n" +
        "immersed in an inner peace. A vibrant joy pervaded the atmosphere.\n" +

        "Feast your eyes; enjoy the artistic splendors of this palace,\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Brother, I said, the beauty of this structure surpasses the\n" +
        "bounds of human imagination. Please tell me the mystery of its\n" +
        "origin.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I will gladly enlighten you. My companions dark eyes sparkled\n" +
        "with wisdom. In reality there is nothing inexplicable about this\n" +
        "materialization. The whole cosmos is a materialized thought of the\n" +
        "Creator. This heavy, earthly clod, floating in space, is a dream\n" +
        "of God. He made all things out of His consciousness, even as man\n" +
        "in his dream consciousness reproduces and vivifies a creation with\n" +
        "its creatures.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "God first created the earth as an idea. Then He quickened it;\n" +
        "energy atoms came into being. He coordinated the atoms into this\n" +
        "solid sphere. All its molecules are held together by the will of\n" +
        "God. When He withdraws His will, the earth again will disintegrate\n" +
        "into energy. Energy will dissolve into consciousness; the earth-idea\n" +
        "will disappear from objectivity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The substance of a dream is held in materialization by the\n" +
        "subconscious thought of the dreamer. When that cohesive thought\n" +
        "is withdrawn in wakefulness, the dream and its elements dissolve.\n" +
        "A man closes his eyes and erects a dream-creation which, on awakening,\n" +
        "he effortlessly dematerializes. He follows the divine archetypal\n" +
        "pattern. Similarly, when he awakens in cosmic consciousness, he\n" +
        "will effortlessly dematerialize the illusions of the cosmic dream.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Being one with the infinite all-accomplishing Will, Babaji can\n" +
        "summon the elemental atoms to combine and manifest themselves in\n" +
        "any form. This golden palace, instantaneously created, is real,\n" +
        "even as this earth is real. Babaji created this palatial mansion out\n" +
        "of his mind and is holding its atoms together by the power of his\n" +
        "will, even as God created this earth and is maintaining it intact.\n" +

        "dematerialize it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I remained silent in awe, my guide made a sweeping gesture. This\n" +
        "shimmering palace, superbly embellished with jewels, has not been\n" +
        "built by human effort or with laboriously mined gold and gems. It\n" +
        "stands solidly, a monumental challenge to man. Whoever\n" +
        "realizes himself as a son of God, even as Babaji has done, can\n" +
        "reach any goal by the infinite powers hidden within him. A common\n" +
        "stone locks within itself the secret of stupendous atomic energy;\n" +
        " even so, a mortal is yet a powerhouse of divinity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The sage picked up from a near-by table a graceful vase whose handle\n" +

        "solidifying myriads of free cosmic rays, he went on. Touch this\n" +
        "vase and its diamonds; they will satisfy all the tests of sensory\n" +
        "experience.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I examined the vase, and passed my hand over the smooth room-walls,\n" +
        "thick with glistening gold. Each of the jewels scattered lavishly\n" +
        "about was worthy of a kings collection. Deep satisfaction spread\n" +
        "over my mind. A submerged desire, hidden in my subconsciousness\n" +
        "from lives now gone, seemed simultaneously gratified and extinguished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My stately companion led me through ornate arches and corridors\n" +
        "into a series of chambers richly furnished in the style of an\n" +

        "a golden throne, encrusted with jewels shedding a dazzling medley\n" +
        "of colors. There, in lotus posture, sat the supreme Babaji. I\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, are you still feasting on your dream desires for a golden\n" +

        "Wake! All your earthly thirsts are about to be quenched forever.\n" +
        "He murmured some mystic words of blessing. My son, arise. Receive\n" +
        "your initiation into the kingdom of God through KRIYA YOGA.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji stretched out his hand; a HOMA (sacrificial) fire appeared,\n" +
        "surrounded by fruits and flowers. I received the liberating yogic\n" +
        "technique before this flaming altar.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for\n" +
        "sleep in my ecstatic state, and wandered around the palace, filled\n" +
        "on all sides with treasures and priceless OBJETS DART. Descending\n" +
        "to the gorgeous gardens, I noticed, near-by, the same caves and\n" +
        "barren mountain ledges which yesterday had boasted no adjacency to\n" +
        "palace or flowered terrace.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Reentering the palace, fabulously glistening in the cold Himalayan\n" +
        "sunlight, I sought the presence of my master. He was still enthroned,\n" +
        "surrounded by many quiet disciples.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, you are hungry. Babaji added, Close your eyes.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque\n" +
        "gardens had disappeared. My own body and the forms of Babaji\n" +
        "and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground\n" +
        "at the exact site of the vanished palace, not far from the sunlit\n" +
        "entrances of the rocky grottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked\n" +
        "that the palace would be dematerialized, its captive atoms released\n" +
        "into the thought-essence from which it had sprung. Although stunned,\n" +
        "I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on\n" +
        "this day of miracles.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,\n" +
        "Babaji explained. He lifted an earthen vessel from the ground. Put\n" +
        "your hand there and receive whatever food you desire.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped\n" +
        "with hot butter-fried LUCHIS, curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped\n" +
        "myself, observing that the vessel was ever-filled. At the end of my\n" +
        "meal I looked around for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before\n" +
        "me. Lo! the food had vanished; in its place was water, clear as\n" +
        "from a mountain stream.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Few mortals know that the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of\n" +
        "mundane fulfillments, Babaji observed. The divine realm extends\n" +
        "to the earthly, but the latter, being illusory, cannot include the\n" +
        "essence of reality.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Beloved guru, last night you demonstrated for me the link of\n" +
        "beauty in heaven and earth! I smiled at memories of the vanished\n" +
        "palace; surely no simple yogi had ever received initiation into the\n" +
        "august mysteries of Spirit amidst surroundings of more impressive\n" +
        "luxury! I gazed tranquilly at the stark contrast of the present\n" +
        "scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves offering primitive\n" +
        "shelter-all seemed a gracious natural setting for the seraphic\n" +
        "saints around me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of\n" +
        "past-life realizations. My divine guru approached and passed his\n" +
        "hand over my head. I entered the NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI state, remaining\n" +
        "unbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive\n" +
        "strata of self-knowledge, I penetrated the deathless realms of\n" +
        "reality. All delusive limitations dropped away; my soul was fully\n" +
        "established on the eternal altar of the Cosmic Spirit. On the eighth\n" +
        "day I fell at my gurus feet and implored him to keep me always\n" +
        "near him in this sacred wilderness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My son, Babaji said, embracing me, your role in this incarnation\n" +
        "must be played on an outward stage. Prenatally blessed by many lives\n" +
        "of lonely meditation, you must now mingle in the world of men.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A deep purpose underlay the fact that you did not meet me this\n" +
        "time until you were already a married man, with modest business\n" +
        "responsibilities. You must put aside your thoughts of joining our\n" +
        "secret band in the Himalayas; your life lies in the crowded marts,\n" +
        "serving as an example of the ideal yogi-householder.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The cries of many bewildered worldly men and women have not fallen\n" +
        "unheard on the ears of the Great Ones, he went on. You have been\n" +
        "chosen to bring spiritual solace through KRIYA YOGA to numerous\n" +
        "earnest seekers. The millions who are encumbered by family ties and\n" +
        "heavy worldly duties will take new heart from you, a householder\n" +
        "like themselves. You must guide them to see that the highest yogic\n" +
        "attainments are not barred to the family man. Even in the world,\n" +
        "the yogi who faithfully discharges his responsibilities, without\n" +
        "personal motive or attachment, treads the sure path of enlightenment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No necessity compels you to leave the world, for inwardly you\n" +
        "have already sundered its every karmic tie. Not of this world, you\n" +
        "must yet be in it. Many years still remain during which you must\n" +
        "conscientiously fulfill your family, business, civic, and spiritual\n" +
        "duties. A sweet new breath of divine hope will penetrate the\n" +
        "arid hearts of worldly men. From your balanced life, they will\n" +
        "understand that liberation is dependent on inner, rather than outer,\n" +
        "renunciations.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How remote seemed my family, the office, the world, as I listened\n" +
        "to my guru in the high Himalayan solitudes. Yet adamantine truth\n" +
        "rang in his words; I submissively agreed to leave this blessed\n" +
        "haven of peace. Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules\n" +
        "which govern the transmission of the yogic art from guru to disciple.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bestow the KRIYA key only on qualified chelas, Babaji said.\n" +
        "He who vows to sacrifice all in the quest of the Divine is fit to\n" +
        "unravel the final mysteries of life through the science of meditation.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Angelic guru, as you have already favored mankind by resurrecting\n" +
        "the lost KRIYA art, will you not increase that benefit by relaxing\n" +
        "the strict requirements for discipleship? I gazed beseechingly\n" +
        "at Babaji. I pray that you permit me to communicate KRIYA to all\n" +
        "seekers, even though at first they cannot vow themselves to complete\n" +
        "inner renunciation. The tortured men and women of the world, pursued\n" +
        "by the threefold suffering, need special encouragement.\n" +
        "They may never attempt the road to freedom if KRIYA initiation be\n" +
        "withheld from them.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be it so. The divine wish has been expressed through you. With\n" +
        "these simple words, the merciful guru banished the rigorous safeguards\n" +
        "that for ages had hidden KRIYA from the world. Give KRIYA freely\n" +
        "to all who humbly ask for help.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After a silence, Babaji added, Repeat to each of your disciples\n" +
        "this majestic promise from the BHAGAVAD GITA: SWALPAMASYA DHARMASYA,\n" +
        "TRAYATA MAHATO BHOYAT--Even a little bit of the practice of this\n" +
        "religion will save you from dire fears and colossal sufferings.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I knelt the next morning at my gurus feet for his farewell\n" +
        "blessing, he sensed my deep reluctance to leave him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There is no separation for us, my beloved child. He touched my\n" +
        "shoulder affectionately. Wherever you are, whenever you call me,\n" +
        "I shall be with you instantly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Consoled by his wondrous promise, and rich with the newly found gold\n" +
        "of God-wisdom, I wended my way down the mountain. At the office I\n" +
        "was welcomed by my fellow employees, who for ten days had thought\n" +
        "me lost in the Himalayan jungles. A letter soon arrived from the\n" +
        "head office.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri should return to the Danapur office, it read.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Before returning to Danapur, I spent a few days with a Bengali\n" +
        "family at Moradabad. A party of six friends gathered to greet me.\n" +
        "As I turned the conversation to spiritual subjects, my host observed\n" +
        "gloomily:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Oh, in these days India is destitute of saints!\n" +
        "\n" +

        "masters in this land!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In a mood of exalted fervor, I felt impelled to relate my miraculous\n" +

        "incredulous.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, one man said soothingly, your mind has been under a\n" +
        "strain in those rarefied mountain airs. This is some daydream you\n" +
        "have recounted.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Burning with the enthusiasm of truth, I spoke without due thought.\n" +
        "If I call him, my guru will appear right in this house.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Interest gleamed in every eye; it was no wonder that the group\n" +
        "was eager to behold a saint materialized in such a strange way.\n" +
        "Half-reluctantly, I asked for a quiet room and two new woolen\n" +
        "blankets.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The master will materialize from the ether, I said. Remain\n" +
        "silently outside the door; I shall soon call you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I sank into the meditative state, humbly summoning my guru. The\n" +
        "darkened room soon filled with a dim aural moonlight; the luminous\n" +
        "figure of Babaji emerged.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri, do you call me for a trifle? The masters gaze was stern.\n" +
        "Truth is for earnest seekers, not for those of idle curiosity. It\n" +
        "is easy to believe when one sees; there is nothing then to deny.\n" +
        "Supersensual truth is deserved and discovered by those who overcome\n" +
        "their natural materialistic skepticism. He added gravely, Let me\n" +
        "go!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I fell entreatingly at his feet. Holy guru, I realize my serious\n" +
        "error; I humbly ask pardon. It was to create faith in these\n" +
        "spiritually blinded minds that I ventured to call you. Because you\n" +
        "have graciously appeared at my prayer, please do not depart without\n" +
        "bestowing a blessing on my friends. Unbelievers though they be,\n" +
        "at least they were willing to investigate the truth of my strange\n" +
        "assertions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Very well; I will stay awhile. I do not wish your word discredited\n" +
        "before your friends. Babajis face had softened, but he added\n" +
        "gently, Henceforth, my son, I shall come when you need me, and\n" +
        "not always when you call me. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Tense silence reigned in the little group when I opened the door.\n" +
        "As if mistrusting their senses, my friends stared at the lustrous\n" +
        "figure on the blanket seat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This is mass-hypnotism! One man laughed blatantly. No one could\n" +
        "possibly have entered this room without our knowledge!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji advanced smilingly and motioned to each one to touch the\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Let HALUA be prepared. Babaji made this request,\n" +
        "I knew, to further assure the group of his physical reality. While\n" +
        "the porridge was boiling, the divine guru chatted affably. Great\n" +
        "was the metamorphosis of these doubting Thomases into devout St.\n" +
        "Pauls. After we had eaten, Babaji blessed each of us in turn. There\n" +
        "was a sudden flash; we witnessed the instantaneous dechemicalization\n" +
        "of the electronic elements of Babajis body into a spreading vaporous\n" +
        "light. The God-tuned will power of the master had loosened its\n" +
        "grasp of the ether atoms held together as his body; forthwith the\n" +
        "trillions of tiny lifetronic sparks faded into the infinite reservoir.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With my own eyes I have seen the conqueror of death. Maitra,\n" +

        "to see the Lord as residing equally in all body-temples, whether of\n" +

        "group of disciples. The master, a bright unusual figure, with\n" +
        "sparkling dark eyes, rose at my approach and embraced me.\n" +

        "deep conviction of truth rang in his words; I was engulfed in an\n" +
        "instant wave of spiritual blessing. Smiling at my sudden elevation\n" +
        "into the ancient monastic order, I bowed at the feet of\n" +
        "the obviously great and angelic being in human form who had thus\n" +
        "honored me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji-for it was indeed he-motioned me to a seat near him under\n" +
        "the tree. He was strong and young, and looked like Lahiri Mahasaya;\n" +
        "yet the resemblance did not strike me, even though I had often\n" +
        "heard of the extraordinary similarities in the appearance of the\n" +
        "two masters. Babaji possesses a power by which he can prevent any\n" +
        "specific thought from arising in a persons mind. Evidently the\n" +
        "great guru wished me to be perfectly natural in his presence, not\n" +
        "overawed by knowledge of his identity.\n" +

        "What do you think of the KUMBHA MELA?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was greatly disappointed, sir. I added hastily, Up until the\n" +

        "belong together.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "Everything on earth is of mixed character, like a mingling of sand\n" +
        "and sugar. Be like the wise ant which seizes only the sugar, and\n" +
        "leaves the sand untouched. Though many sadhus here still wander in\n" +
        "delusion, yet the MELA is blessed by a few men of God-realization.\n" +

        "In view of my own meeting with this exalted master, I quickly\n" +
        "agreed with his observation.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "congregated here, living in distant Europe and America, professing\n" +
        "different creeds, and ignorant of the real values of such MELAS\n" +
        "as the present one. They are the men who could benefit greatly by\n" +
        "meetings with Indias masters. But, although high in intellectual\n" +
        "attainments, many Westerners are wedded to rank materialism. Others,\n" +
        "famous in science and philosophy, do not recognize the essential\n" +
        "unity in religion. Their creeds serve as insurmountable barriers\n" +
        "that threaten to separate them from us forever.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I saw that you are interested in the West, as well as the East.\n" +
        "Babajis face beamed with approval. I felt the pangs of your heart,\n" +
        "broad enough for all men, whether Oriental or Occidental. That is\n" +
        "why I summoned you here.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "East and West must establish a golden middle path of activity\n" +
        "and spirituality combined, he continued. India has much to learn\n" +
        "from the West in material development; in return, India can teach\n" +

        "religious beliefs on the unshakable foundations of yogic science.\n" +

        "between Orient and Occident. Some years hence I shall send you\n" +
        "a disciple whom you can train for yoga dissemination in the West.\n" +
        "The vibrations there of many spiritually seeking souls come floodlike\n" +
        "to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe, waiting\n" +
        "to be awakened.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At this point in his story, Sri Yukteswar turned his gaze fully on\n" +

        "\n" +
        "My son, he said, smiling in the moonlight, you are the disciple\n" +

        "West, away from my beloved guru and the simple hermitage peace.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji then spoke of the BHAGAVAD GITA, Sri Yukteswar went on.\n" +
        "To my astonishment, he indicated by a few words of praise that he\n" +
        "was aware of the fact that I had written interpretations on various\n" +
        "GITA chapters.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At my request, Swamiji, please undertake another task, the great\n" +
        "master said. Will you not write a short book on the underlying\n" +
        "basic unity between the Christian and Hindu scriptures? Show by\n" +
        "parallel references that the inspired sons of God have spoken the\n" +
        "same truths, now obscured by mens sectarian differences.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Maharaj, I answered diffidently, what a command! Shall\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Babaji laughed softly. My son, why do you doubt? he said\n" +
        "reassuringly. Indeed, Whose work is all this, and Who is the\n" +
        "Doer of all actions? Whatever the Lord has made me say is bound to\n" +
        "materialize as truth.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I deemed myself empowered by the blessings of the saint, and agreed\n" +
        "to write the book. Feeling reluctantly that the parting-hour had\n" +
        "arrived, I rose from my leafy seat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do you know Lahiri? the master inquired. He is a\n" +
        "great soul, isnt he? Tell him of our meeting. He then gave me a\n" +
        "message for Lahiri Mahasaya.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After I had bowed humbly in farewell, the saint smiled benignly.\n" +
        "When your book is finished, I shall pay you a visit, he promised.\n" +
        "Good-by for the present.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I left Allahabad the following day and entrained for Benares.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Oh, didnt you recognize him? Lahiri Mahasayas eyes were dancing\n" +
        "with laughter. I see you couldnt, for he prevented you. He is my\n" +
        "incomparable guru, the celestial Babaji!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Babaji! I repeated, awestruck. The Yogi-Christ Babaji! The\n" +

        "past and be once more in his presence, to show my devotion at his\n" +
        "lotus feet!\n" +
        "\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Gurudeva, the divine master asked me to give you a message. Tell\n" +

        "low; it is nearly finished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At my utterance of these enigmatic words, Lahiri Mahasayas figure\n" +
        "trembled as though touched by a lightning current. In an instant\n" +
        "everything about him fell silent; his smiling countenance turned\n" +
        "incredibly stern. Like a wooden statue, somber and immovable in\n" +
        "its seat, his body became colorless. I was alarmed and bewildered.\n" +
        "Never in my life had I seen this joyous soul manifest such awful\n" +
        "gravity. The other disciples present stared apprehensively.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Three hours passed in utter silence. Then Lahiri Mahasaya resumed\n" +
        "his natural, cheerful demeanor, and spoke affectionately to each\n" +
        "of the chelas. Everyone sighed in relief.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I realized by my masters reaction that Babajis message had been\n" +
        "an unmistakable signal by which Lahiri Mahasaya understood that his\n" +
        "body would soon be untenanted. His awesome silence proved that\n" +
        "my guru had instantly controlled his being, cut his last cord\n" +
        "of attachment to the material world, and fled to his ever-living\n" +
        "identity in Spirit. Babajis remark had been his way of saying:\n" +
        "I shall be ever with you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Though Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya were omniscient, and had\n" +
        "no need of communicating with each other through me or any other\n" +
        "intermediary, the great ones often condescend to play a part in the\n" +
        "human drama. Occasionally they transmit their prophecies through\n" +
        "messengers in an ordinary way, that the final fulfillment of their\n" +
        "words may infuse greater divine faith in a wide circle of men who\n" +
        "later learn the story.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I soon left Benares, and set to work in Serampore on the scriptural\n" +
        "writings requested by Babaji, Sri Yukteswar continued. No sooner\n" +
        "had I begun my task than I was able to compose a poem dedicated to\n" +
        "the deathless guru. The melodious lines flowed effortlessly from\n" +
        "my pen, though never before had I attempted Sanskrit poetry.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "words of the blessed Lord Jesus, I showed that his teachings were\n" +
        "in essence one with the revelations of the VEDAS. To my relief,\n" +
        "my book was finished in a short time; I realized that this speedy\n" +
        "blessing was due to the grace of my PARAM-GURU-MAHARAJ. \n" +

        "were privately printed as a book by one of my Kidderpore disciples.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The morning after I had concluded my literary efforts, Master\n" +
        "continued, I went to the Rai Ghat here to bathe in the Ganges.\n" +
        "The ghat was deserted; I stood still for awhile, enjoying the sunny\n" +
        "peace. After a dip in the sparkling waters, I started for home.\n" +
        "The only sound in the silence was that of my Ganges-drenched cloth,\n" +
        "swish-swashing with every step. As I passed beyond the site of the\n" +
        "large banyan tree near the river bank, a strong impulse urged me\n" +
        "to look back. There, under the shade of the banyan, and surrounded\n" +
        "by a few disciples, sat the great Babaji!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Greetings, Swamiji! The beautiful voice of the master rang\n" +
        "out to assure me I was not dreaming. I see you have successfully\n" +
        "completed your book. As I promised, I am here to thank you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With a fast-beating heart, I prostrated myself fully at his feet.\n" +
        "Param-guruji, I said imploringly, will you and your chelas not\n" +
        "honor my near-by home with your presence?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The supreme guru smilingly declined. No, child, he said, we are\n" +
        "people who like the shelter of trees; this spot is quite comfortable.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please tarry awhile, Master. I gazed entreatingly at him. I\n" +
        "shall be back at once with some special sweetmeats.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I returned in a few minutes with a dish of delicacies, lo! the\n" +
        "lordly banyan no longer sheltered the celestial troupe. I searched\n" +
        "all around the ghat, but in my heart I knew the little band had\n" +
        "already fled on etheric wings.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was deeply hurt. Even if we meet again, I would not care to talk\n" +
        "to him, I assured myself. He was unkind to leave me so suddenly.\n" +
        "This was a wrath of love, of course, and nothing more.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A few months later I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. As I\n" +
        "entered his little parlor, my guru smiled in greeting.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Welcome, Yukteswar, he said. Did you just meet Babaji at the\n" +
        "threshold of my room?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why, no, I answered in surprise.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come here. Lahiri Mahasaya touched me gently on the forehead;\n" +
        "at once I beheld, near the door, the form of Babaji, blooming like\n" +
        "a perfect lotus.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I remembered my old hurt, and did not bow. Lahiri Mahasaya looked\n" +
        "at me in astonishment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The divine guru gazed at me with fathomless eyes. You are annoyed\n" +
        "with me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sir, why shouldnt I be? I answered. Out of the air you came\n" +
        "with your magic group, and into the thin air you vanished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I told you I would see you, but didnt say how long I would remain.\n" +
        "Babaji laughed softly. You were full of excitement. I assure you\n" +
        "that I was fairly extinguished in the ether by the gust of your\n" +
        "restlessness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was instantly satisfied by this unflattering explanation. I\n" +
        "knelt at his feet; the supreme guru patted me kindly on the shoulder.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Child, you must meditate more, he said. Your gaze is not yet\n" +
        "faultless-you could not see me hiding behind the sunlight. With\n" +
        "these words in the voice of a celestial flute, Babaji disappeared\n" +
        "into the hidden radiance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That was one of my last visits to Benares to see my guru, Sri\n" +
        "Yukteswar concluded. Even as Babaji had foretold at the KUMBHA\n" +
        "MELA, the householder-incarnation of Lahiri Mahasaya was drawing\n" +
        "to a close. During the summer of 1895 his stalwart body developed\n" +
        "a small boil on the back. He protested against lancing; he was working\n" +
        "out in his own flesh the evil karma of some of his disciples. Finally\n" +
        "a few chelas became very insistent; the master replied cryptically:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The body has to find a cause to go; I will be agreeable to whatever\n" +
        "you want to do.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A short time later the incomparable guru gave up his body in\n" +
        "Benares. No longer need I seek him out in his little parlor; I\n" +
        "find every day of my life blessed by his omnipresent guidance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years later, from the lips of Swami Keshabananda, an\n" +
        "advanced disciple, I heard many wonderful details about the passing\n" +
        "of Lahiri Mahasaya.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A few days before my guru relinquished his body, Keshabananda told\n" +
        "me, he materialized himself before me as I sat in my hermitage at\n" +
        "Hardwar.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come at once to Benares. With these words Lahiri Mahasaya\n" +
        "vanished.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I entrained immediately for Benares. At my gurus home I found\n" +
        "many disciples assembled. For hours that day the master\n" +
        "expounded the GITA; then he addressed us simply.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I am going home.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sobs of anguish broke out like an irresistible torrent.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Be comforted; I shall rise again. After this utterance Lahiri\n" +
        "Mahasaya thrice turned his body around in a circle, faced the north\n" +
        "in his lotus posture, and gloriously entered the final MAHA-SAMADHI.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lahiri Mahasayas beautiful body, so dear to the devotees, was\n" +
        "cremated with solemn householder rites at Manikarnika Ghat by the\n" +
        "holy Ganges, Keshabananda continued. The following day, at ten\n" +
        "oclock in the morning, while I was still in Benares, my room was\n" +
        "suffused with a great light. Lo! before me stood the flesh and\n" +
        "blood form of Lahiri Mahasaya! It looked exactly like his old body,\n" +
        "except that it appeared younger and more radiant. My divine guru\n" +
        "spoke to me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Keshabananda, he said, it is I. From the disintegrated atoms\n" +
        "of my cremated body, I have resurrected a remodeled form. My\n" +
        "householder work in the world is done; but I do not leave the earth\n" +
        "entirely. Henceforth I shall spend some time with Babaji in the\n" +
        "Himalayas, and with Babaji in the cosmos.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With a few words of blessing to me, the transcendent master\n" +
        "vanished. Wondrous inspiration filled my heart; I was uplifted\n" +
        "in Spirit even as were the disciples of Christ and Kabir \n" +
        "when they had gazed on their living gurus after physical death.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I returned to my isolated Hardwar hermitage, Keshabananda\n" +
        "went on, I carried with me the sacred ashes of my guru. I know he\n" +
        "has escaped the spatio-temporal cage; the bird of omnipresence is\n" +
        "freed. Yet it comforted my heart to enshrine his sacred remains.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Another disciple who was blessed by the sight of his resurrected\n" +
        "guru was the saintly Panchanon Bhattacharya, founder of the Calcutta\n" +
        "Arya Mission Institution. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "I visited Panchanon at his Calcutta home, and listened with delight\n" +
        "to the story of his many years with the master. In conclusion, he\n" +
        "told me of the most marvelous event in his life.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Here in Calcutta, Panchanon said, at ten oclock of the morning\n" +
        "which followed his cremation, Lahiri Mahasaya appeared before me\n" +
        "in living glory.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swami Pranabananda, the saint with two bodies, also confided to\n" +
        "me the details of his own supernal experience.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A few days before Lahiri Mahasaya left his body, Pranabananda told\n" +
        "me at the time he visited my Ranchi school, I received a letter\n" +
        "from him, requesting me to come at once to Benares. I was delayed,\n" +
        "however, and could not leave immediately. As I was in the midst\n" +
        "of my travel preparations, about ten oclock in the morning, I was\n" +
        "suddenly overwhelmed with joy to see the shining figure of my guru.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Why hurry to Benares? Lahiri Mahasaya said, smiling. You shall\n" +
        "find me there no longer.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the import of his words dawned on me, I sobbed broken-heartedly,\n" +
        "believing that I was seeing him only in a vision.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The master approached me comfortingly. Here, touch my flesh,\n" +
        "he said. I am living, as always. Do not lament; am I not with you\n" +
        "forever?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "From the lips of these three great disciples, a story of wondrous\n" +
        "truth has emerged: At the morning hour of ten, on the day after\n" +
        "the body of Lahiri Mahasaya had been consigned to the flames, the\n" +
        "resurrected master, in a real but transfigured body, appeared before\n" +
        "three disciples, each one in a different city.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this\n" +
        "mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass\n" +
        "the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O\n" +
        "death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "America! Surely these people are Americans! This was my thought\n" +
        "as a panoramic vision of Western faces passed before my inward\n" +
        "view.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Immersed in meditation, I was sitting behind some dusty boxes in\n" +
        "the storeroom of the Ranchi school. A private spot was difficult\n" +
        "to find during those busy years with the youngsters!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The vision continued; a vast multitude, gazing at me\n" +
        "intently, swept actorlike across the stage of consciousness.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The storeroom door opened; as usual, one of the young lads had\n" +
        "discovered my hiding place.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Come here, Bimal, I cried gaily. I have news for you: the Lord\n" +
        "is calling me to America!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "To America? The boy echoed my words in a tone that implied I had\n" +
        "said to the moon.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes! I am going forth to discover America, like Columbus. He\n" +
        "thought he had found India; surely there is a karmic link between\n" +
        "those two lands!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bimal scampered away; soon the whole school was informed by the\n" +
        "two-legged newspaper. I summoned the bewildered faculty\n" +
        "and gave the school into its charge.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I know you will keep Lahiri Mahasayas yoga ideals of education ever\n" +
        "to the fore, I said. I shall write you frequently; God willing,\n" +
        "someday I shall be back.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Tears stood in my eyes as I cast a last look at the little boys\n" +
        "and the sunny acres of Ranchi. A definite epoch in my life had now\n" +
        "closed, I knew; henceforth I would dwell in far lands. I entrained\n" +
        "for Calcutta a few hours after my vision. The following day I\n" +
        "received an invitation to serve as the delegate from India to an\n" +
        "International Congress of Religious Liberals in America. It was\n" +
        "to convene that year in Boston, under the auspices of the American\n" +
        "Unitarian Association.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My head in a whirl, I sought out Sri Yukteswar in Serampore.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Guruji, I have just been invited to address a religious congress\n" +
        "in America. Shall I go?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "All doors are open for you, Master replied simply. It is now or\n" +
        "never.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But, sir, I said in dismay, what do I know about public speaking?\n" +
        "Seldom have I given a lecture, and never in English.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "English or no English, your words on yoga shall be heard in the\n" +
        "West.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I laughed. Well, dear guruji, I hardly think the Americans will\n" +
        "learn Bengali! Please bless me with a push over the hurdles of the\n" +
        "English language. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "When I broke the news of my plans to Father, he was utterly taken\n" +
        "aback. To him America seemed incredibly remote; he feared he might\n" +
        "never see me again.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How can you go? he asked sternly. Who will finance you? As he\n" +
        "had affectionately borne the expenses of my education and whole\n" +
        "life, he doubtless hoped that his question would bring my project\n" +
        "to an embarrassing halt.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Lord will surely finance me. As I made this reply, I thought\n" +
        "of the similar one I had given long ago to my brother Ananta in\n" +
        "Agra. Without very much guile, I added, Father, perhaps God will\n" +
        "put it into your mind to help me.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, never! He glanced at me piteously.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was astounded, therefore, when Father handed me, the following\n" +
        "day, a check made out for a large amount.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I give you this money, he said, not in my capacity as a father,\n" +
        "but as a faithful disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Go then to that far\n" +
        "Western land; spread there the creedless teachings of KRIYA YOGA.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was immensely touched at the selfless spirit in which Father\n" +
        "had been able to quickly put aside his personal desires. The just\n" +
        "realization had come to him during the preceding night that no\n" +
        "ordinary desire for foreign travel was motivating my voyage.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Perhaps we shall not meet again in this life. Father, who was\n" +
        "sixty-seven at this time, spoke sadly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "An intuitive conviction prompted me to reply, Surely the Lord will\n" +
        "bring us together once more.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I went about my preparations to leave Master and my native\n" +
        "land for the unknown shores of America, I experienced not a little\n" +
        "trepidation. I had heard many stories about the materialistic\n" +
        "Western atmosphere, one very different from the spiritual background\n" +
        "of India, pervaded with the centuried aura of saints. An Oriental\n" +
        "teacher who will dare the Western airs, I thought, must be hardy\n" +
        "beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "One early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination\n" +
        "to continue, to even die praying, until I heard the voice of God.\n" +
        "I wanted His blessing and assurance that I would not lose myself\n" +
        "in the fogs of modern utilitarianism. My heart was set to go to\n" +
        "America, but even more strongly was it resolved to hear the solace\n" +
        "of divine permission.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I prayed and prayed, muffling my sobs. No answer came. My silent\n" +
        "petition increased in excruciating crescendo until, at noon, I had\n" +
        "reached a zenith; my brain could no longer withstand the pressure\n" +
        "of my agonies. If I cried once more with an increased depth of my\n" +
        "inner passion, I felt as though my brain would split. At that moment\n" +
        "there came a knock outside the vestibule adjoining the Gurpar Road\n" +
        "room in which I was sitting. Opening the door, I saw a young man\n" +
        "in the scanty garb of a renunciate. He came in, closed the door\n" +
        "behind him and, refusing my request to sit down, indicated with a\n" +
        "gesture that he wished to talk to me while standing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He must be Babaji! I thought, dazed, because the man before me\n" +
        "had the features of a younger Lahiri Mahasaya.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He answered my thought. Yes, I am Babaji. He spoke melodiously\n" +
        "in Hindi. Our Heavenly Father has heard your prayer. He commands\n" +
        "me to tell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America.\n" +
        "Fear not; you will be protected.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. You are the one\n" +
        "I have chosen to spread the message of KRIYA YOGA in the West. Long\n" +
        "ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a KUMBHA MELA; I told him then I\n" +
        "would send you to him for training.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and\n" +
        "deeply touched to hear from his own lips that he had guided me\n" +
        "to Sri Yukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He\n" +
        "graciously lifted me from the floor. Telling me many things about\n" +
        "my life, he then gave me some personal instruction, and uttered a\n" +
        "few secret prophecies.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "KRIYA YOGA, the scientific technique of God-realization, he finally\n" +
        "said with solemnity, will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid\n" +
        "in harmonizing the nations through mans personal, transcendental\n" +
        "perception of the Infinite Father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With a gaze of majestic power, the master electrified me by a\n" +
        "glimpse of his cosmic consciousness. In a short while he started\n" +
        "toward the door.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do not try to follow me, he said. You will not be able to do\n" +
        "so.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Please, Babaji, dont go away! I cried repeatedly. Take me with\n" +
        "you!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Looking back, he replied, Not now. Some other time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Overcome by emotion, I disregarded his warning. As I tried to pursue\n" +
        "him, I discovered that my feet were firmly rooted to the floor.\n" +
        "From the door, Babaji gave me a last affectionate glance. He raised\n" +
        "his hand by way of benediction and walked away, my eyes fixed on\n" +
        "him longingly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After a few minutes my feet were free. I sat down and went into a\n" +
        "deep meditation, unceasingly thanking God not only for answering my\n" +
        "prayer but for blessing me by a meeting with Babaji. My whole body\n" +
        "seemed sanctified through the touch of the ancient, ever-youthful\n" +
        "master. Long had it been my burning desire to behold him.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Until now, I have never recounted to anyone this story of my meeting\n" +
        "with Babaji. Holding it as the most sacred of my human experiences,\n" +
        "I have hidden it in my heart. But the thought occurred to me that\n" +
        "readers of this autobiography may be more inclined to believe in\n" +

        "(1) Therese, born in 1898, had been injured in an accident at the\n" +
        "age of twenty; she became blind and paralyzed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "(2) She miraculously regained her sight in 1923 through prayers\n" +
        "to St. Teresa, The Little Flower. Later Therese Neumanns limbs\n" +
        "were instantaneously healed.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "(3) From 1923 onward, Therese has abstained completely from food\n" +
        "and drink, except for the daily swallowing of one small consecrated\n" +
        "wafer.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "(4) The stigmata, or sacred wounds of Christ, appeared in 1926 on\n" +
        "Thereses head, breast, hands, and feet. On Friday of every week\n" +
        "thereafter, she has passed through the Passion of Christ, suffering\n" +
        "in her own body all his historic agonies.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "(5) Knowing ordinarily only the simple German of her village,\n" +
        "during her Friday trances Therese utters phrases which scholars\n" +
        "have identified as ancient Aramaic. At appropriate times in her\n" +
        "vision, she speaks Hebrew or Greek.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "(6) By ecclesiastical permission, Therese has several times been\n" +
        "under close scientific observation. Dr Fritz Gerlick, editor of\n" +
        "a Protestant German newspaper, went to Konnersreuth to expose the\n" +
        "Catholic fraud, but ended up by reverently writing her biography.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "As always, whether in East or West, I was eager to meet a saint.\n" +
        "I rejoiced as our little party entered, on July 16th, the quaint\n" +
        "village of Konnersreuth. The Bavarian peasants exhibited lively\n" +
        "interest in our Ford automobile (brought with us from America) and\n" +

        "Deeply touched at these words, I followed Dr Wurz upstairs to the\n" +
        "sitting room. Therese entered immediately, radiating an aura of\n" +
        "peace and joy. She wore a black gown and spotless white head dress.\n" +
        "Although her age was thirty-seven at this time, she seemed much\n" +
        "younger, possessing indeed a childlike freshness and charm. Healthy,\n" +
        "well-formed, rosy-cheeked, and cheerful, this is the saint that\n" +
        "does not eat!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Therese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed\n" +
        "in silent communion, each knowing the other to be a lover of God.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dr Wurz kindly offered to serve as interpreter. As we seated\n" +
        "ourselves, I noticed that Therese was glancing at me with naive\n" +
        "curiosity; evidently Hindus had been rare in Bavaria.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dont you eat anything? I wanted to hear the answer from her own\n" +
        "lips.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "No, except a consecrated rice-flour wafer, once every morning at\n" +
        "six oclock.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How large is the wafer?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is paper-thin, the size of a small coin. She added, I take\n" +
        "it for sacramental reasons; if it is unconsecrated, I am unable to\n" +
        "swallow it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Certainly you could not have lived on that, for twelve whole\n" +
        "years?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I live by Gods light. How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I see you realize that energy flows to your body from the ether,\n" +
        "sun, and air.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A swift smile broke over her face. I am so happy to know you\n" +
        "understand how I live.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your sacred life is a daily demonstration of the truth uttered by\n" +
        "Christ: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that\n" +
        "proceedeth out of the mouth of God. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Again she showed joy at my explanation. It is indeed so. One of\n" +
        "the reasons I am here on earth today is to prove that man can live\n" +
        "by Gods invisible light, and not by food only.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Can you teach others how to live without food?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "She appeared a trifle shocked. I cannot do that; God does not wish\n" +
        "it.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As my gaze fell on her strong, graceful hands, Therese showed me\n" +
        "a little, square, freshly healed wound on each of her palms. On\n" +
        "the back of each hand, she pointed out a smaller, crescent-shaped\n" +
        "wound, freshly healed. Each wound went straight through the hand.\n" +
        "The sight brought to my mind distinct recollection of the large\n" +
        "square iron nails with crescent-tipped ends, still used in the\n" +
        "Orient, but which I do not recall having seen in the West.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint told me something of her weekly trances. As a helpless\n" +
        "onlooker, I observe the whole Passion of Christ. Each week, from\n" +
        "Thursday midnight until Friday afternoon at one oclock, her wounds\n" +
        "open and bleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121-pound\n" +
        "weight. Suffering intensely in her sympathetic love, Therese yet\n" +
        "looks forward joyously to these weekly visions of her Lord.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I realized at once that her strange life is intended by God to reassure\n" +
        "all Christians of the historical authenticity of Jesus life and\n" +
        "crucifixion as recorded in the New Testament, and to dramatically\n" +
        "display the ever-living bond between the Galilean Master and his\n" +
        "devotees.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Professor Wurz related some of his experiences with the saint.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Several of us, including Therese, often travel for days on\n" +
        "sight-seeing trips throughout Germany, he told me. It is a striking\n" +
        "contrast-while we have three meals a day, Therese eats nothing.\n" +
        "She remains as fresh as a rose, untouched by the fatigue which the\n" +
        "trips cause us. As we grow hungry and hunt for wayside inns, she\n" +
        "laughs merrily.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The professor added some interesting physiological details: Because\n" +
        "Therese takes no food, her stomach has shrunk. She has no excretions,\n" +
        "but her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and\n" +
        "firm.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At the time of parting, I expressed to Therese my desire to be\n" +
        "present at her trance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, please come to Konnersreuth next Friday, she said graciously.\n" +
        "The bishop will give you a permit. I am very happy you sought me\n" +
        "out in Eichstatt.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Therese shook hands gently, many times, and walked with our party\n" +
        "to the gate. Mr Wright turned on the automobile radio; the saint\n" +
        "examined it with little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd\n" +
        "of youngsters gathered that Therese retreated into the house. We\n" +
        "saw her at a window, where she peered at us, childlike, waving her\n" +
        "hand.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "From a conversation the next day with two of Thereses brothers,\n" +
        "very kind and amiable, we learned that the saint sleeps only one\n" +
        "or two hours at night. In spite of the many wounds in her body,\n" +
        "she is active and full of energy. She loves birds, looks after an\n" +
        "aquarium of fish, and works often in her garden. Her correspondence\n" +
        "is large; Catholic devotees write her for prayers and healing\n" +
        "blessings. Many seekers have been cured through her of serious\n" +
        "diseases.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Her brother Ferdinand, about twenty-three, explained that Therese\n" +
        "has the power, through prayer, of working out on her own body the\n" +
        "ailments of others. The saints abstinence from food dates from a\n" +
        "time when she prayed that the throat disease of a young man of her\n" +
        "parish, then preparing to enter holy orders, be transferred to her\n" +
        "own throat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop,\n" +
        "who looked at my flowing locks with some surprise. He readily\n" +
        "wrote out the necessary permit. There was no fee; the rule made by\n" +
        "the Church is simply to protect Therese from the onrush of casual\n" +
        "tourists, who in previous years had flocked on Fridays by the\n" +
        "thousands.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We arrived Friday morning about nine-thirty in Konnersreuth. I\n" +
        "noticed that Thereses little cottage possesses a special glass-roofed\n" +
        "section to afford her plenty of light. We were glad to see the\n" +
        "doors no longer closed, but wide-open in hospitable cheer. There\n" +
        "was a line of about twenty visitors, armed with their permits. Many\n" +
        "had come from great distances to view the mystic trance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Therese had passed my first test at the professors house by her\n" +
        "intuitive knowledge that I wanted to see her for spiritual reasons,\n" +
        "and not just to satisfy a passing curiosity.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My second test was connected with the fact that, just before I\n" +
        "went upstairs to her room, I put myself into a yogic trance state\n" +
        "in order to be one with her in telepathic and televisic rapport. I\n" +
        "entered her chamber, filled with visitors; she was lying in a white\n" +
        "robe on the bed. With Mr Wright following closely behind me, I\n" +
        "halted just inside the threshold, awestruck at a strange and most\n" +
        "frightful spectacle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Blood flowed thinly and continuously in an inch-wide stream from\n" +
        "Thereses lower eyelids. Her gaze was focused upward on the spiritual\n" +
        "eye within the central forehead. The cloth wrapped around her head\n" +
        "was drenched in blood from the stigmata wounds of the crown of\n" +
        "thorns. The white garment was redly splotched over her heart from\n" +
        "the wound in her side at the spot where Christs body, long ages\n" +
        "ago, had suffered the final indignity of the soldiers spear-thrust.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Thereses hands were extended in a gesture maternal, pleading;\n" +
        "her face wore an expression both tortured and divine. She appeared\n" +
        "thinner, changed in many subtle as well as outward ways. Murmuring\n" +
        "words in a foreign tongue, she spoke with slightly quivering lips\n" +
        "to persons visible before her inner sight.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I was in attunement with her, I began to see the scenes of\n" +
        "her vision. She was watching Jesus as he carried the cross amidst\n" +
        "the jeering multitude. Suddenly she lifted her head\n" +
        "in consternation: the Lord had fallen under the cruel weight. The\n" +
        "vision disappeared. In the exhaustion of fervid pity, Therese sank\n" +
        "heavily against her pillow.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At this moment I heard a loud thud behind me. Turning my head for\n" +
        "a second, I saw two men carrying out a prostrate body. But because\n" +
        "I was coming out of the deep superconscious state, I did not\n" +
        "immediately recognize the fallen person. Again I fixed my eyes on\n" +
        "Thereses face, deathly pale under the rivulets of blood, but now\n" +
        "calm, radiating purity and holiness. I glanced behind me later\n" +
        "and saw Mr Wright standing with his hand against his cheek, from\n" +
        "which blood was trickling.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dick, I inquired anxiously, were you the one who fell?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yes, I fainted at the terrifying spectacle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Well, I said consolingly, you are brave to return and look upon\n" +
        "the sight again.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Remembering the patiently waiting line of pilgrims, Mr Wright and\n" +
        "I silently bade farewell to Therese and left her sacred presence.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The following day our little group motored south, thankful that we\n" +
        "were not dependent on trains, but could stop the Ford wherever we\n" +
        "chose throughout the countryside. We enjoyed every minute of a tour\n" +

        "\n" +
        "My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the\n" +
        "privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager\n" +
        "sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head\n" +
        "offered his souls gratitude and greeting, touching with his hand\n" +
        "his gurus feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He rose\n" +

        "\n" +
        "No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was\n" +
        "expressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled\n" +
        "and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender\n" +
        "vibration surged through the quiet patio, and even the sun eluded\n" +
        "the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On bended knee before the master I gave my own unexpressed love\n" +

        "deep eyes smouldering with introspection, yet radiant with joy.\n" +
        "We entered his sitting room, whose whole side opened to the outer\n" +
        "balcony first seen from the street. The master braced himself\n" +
        "against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered mattress on the\n" +
        "cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the gurus feet, with\n" +

        "they are together, although Swamiji Maharaj, as the great guru\n" +
        "is called by others, can and often does speak it. But I perceived\n" +
        "the saintliness of the Great One through his heart-warming smile\n" +
        "and twinkling eyes. One quality easily discernible in his merry,\n" +
        "serious conversation is a decided positiveness in statement-the\n" +
        "mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, because he knows God. His\n" +
        "great wisdom, strength of purpose, and determination are apparent\n" +
        "in every way.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Studying him reverently from time to time, I noted that he is of\n" +
        "large, athletic stature, hardened by the trials and sacrifices of\n" +
        "renunciation. His poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead,\n" +
        "as if seeking the heavens, dominates his divine countenance. He\n" +
        "has a rather large and homely nose, with which he amuses himself\n" +
        "in idle moments, flipping and wiggling it with his fingers, like a\n" +
        "child. His powerful dark eyes are haloed by an ethereal blue ring.\n" +
        "His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver and changes to\n" +
        "streaks of silvery-gold and silvery-black, ending in ringlets at\n" +
        "his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out,\n" +
        "yet seem to enhance his features and, like his character, are deep\n" +
        "and light at the same time.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his\n" +
        "chest, causing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very\n" +
        "cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their\n" +
        "power, as are his muscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread\n" +
        "and erect posture.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "He was clad simply in the common DHOTI and shirt, both once dyed\n" +
        "a strong ocher color, but now a faded orange.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested\n" +
        "the owners non-attachment to material comforts. The weather-stained\n" +
        "white walls of the long chamber were streaked with fading blue\n" +
        "plaster. At one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya,\n" +
        "garlanded in simple devotion. There was also an old picture showing\n" +
        "Yoganandaji as he had first arrived in Boston, standing with the\n" +
        "other delegates to the Congress of Religions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation. A\n" +
        "huge, cut-glass, candle-light chandelier was covered with cobwebs\n" +
        "through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up-to-date calendar.\n" +
        "The whole room emanated a fragrance of peace and calmness. Beyond\n" +
        "the balcony I could see coconut trees towering over the hermitage\n" +
        "in silent protection.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is interesting to observe that the master has merely to clap\n" +
        "his hands together and, before finishing, he is served or attended\n" +
        "by some small disciple. Incidentally, I am much attracted to one\n" +
        "of them-a thin lad, named Prafulla, with long black hair\n" +
        "to his shoulders, a most penetrating pair of sparkling black eyes,\n" +
        "and a heavenly smile; his eyes twinkle, as the corners of his mouth\n" +
        "rise, like the stars and the crescent moon appearing at twilight.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Swami Sri Yukteswarjis joy is obviously intense at the return of\n" +
        "his product (and he seems to be somewhat inquisitive about the\n" +
        "products product). However, predominance of the wisdom-aspect\n" +
        "in the Great Ones nature hinders his outward expression of feeling.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts, as is the custom when\n" +
        "the disciple returns to his guru. We sat down later to a simple\n" +
        "but well-cooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice\n" +
        "combinations. Sri Yukteswarji was pleased at my use of a number of\n" +
        "Indian customs, finger-eating for example.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange\n" +
        "of warm smiles and joyful glances, we paid obeisance at his feet,\n" +
        "bade adieu with a PRONAM, and departed for Calcutta with\n" +
        "an everlasting memory of a sacred meeting and greeting. Although I\n" +
        "write chiefly of my external impressions of him, yet I was always\n" +
        "conscious of the true basis of the saint-his spiritual glory. I\n" +
        "felt his power, and shall carry that feeling as my divine blessing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "From America, Europe, and Palestine I had brought many presents\n" +
        "for Sri Yukteswar. He received them smilingly, but without remark.\n" +
        "For my own use, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella-cane.\n" +
        "In India I decided to give the cane to Master.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This gift I appreciate indeed! My gurus eyes were turned on me\n" +
        "with affectionate understanding as he made the unwonted comment.\n" +

        "display to visitors.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Master, please permit me to get a new carpet for the sitting room.\n" +
        "I had noticed that Sri Yukteswars tiger skin was placed over a\n" +
        "torn rug.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Do so if it pleases you. My gurus voice was not enthusiastic.\n" +
        "Behold, my tiger mat is nice and clean; I am monarch in my own\n" +

        "As soon as I could tear myself away from Serampore and Calcutta,\n" +
        "I set out, with Mr Wright, for Ranchi. What a welcome there, a\n" +
        "veritable ovation! Tears stood in my eyes as I embraced the selfless\n" +
        "teachers who had kept the banner of the school flying during my\n" +
        "fifteen years absence. The bright faces and happy smiles of the\n" +

        "their many-sided school and yoga training.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "had been converted into the central school building, and who had\n" +
        "made many princely donations was now dead. Many free, benevolent\n" +
        "features of the school were now seriously endangered for lack of\n" +

        "\n" +
        "I had not spent years in America without learning some of its\n" +
        "practical wisdom, its undaunted spirit before obstacles. For one\n" +
        "week I remained in Ranchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then\n" +
        "came interviews in Calcutta with prominent leaders and educators,\n" +
        "a long talk with the young Maharaja of Kasimbazar, a financial\n" +
        "appeal to my father, and lo! the shaky foundations of Ranchi began\n" +
        "to be righted. Many donations including one huge check arrived in\n" +
        "the nick of time from my American students.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Within a few months after my arrival in India, I had the joy of\n" +
        "seeing the Ranchi school legally incorporated. My lifelong dream\n" +
        "of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled.\n" +
        "That vision had guided me in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a\n" +
        "group of seven boys.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope far beyond\n" +
        "the boys school. Widespread humanitarian activities are now carried\n" +
        "on there in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The school, or Yogoda Sat-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts\n" +
        "outdoor classes in grammar and high school subjects. The residential\n" +
        "students and day scholars also receive vocational training of some\n" +
        "kind. The boys themselves regulate most of their activities through\n" +
        "autonomous committees. Very early in my career as an educator I\n" +
        "discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher\n" +
        "will cheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are set by their\n" +
        "fellow students. Never a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy\n" +
        "for all boyish pranks and problems.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and\n" +

        "events. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. Muscle recharging\n" +
        "through will power is the YOGODA feature: mental direction of life\n" +
        "energy to any part of the body. The boys are also taught ASANAS\n" +
        "(postures), sword and LATHI (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda\n" +

        "\n" +
        "The unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into KRIYA YOGA.\n" +
        "The boys daily practice their spiritual exercises, engage in GITA\n" +
        "chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of\n" +
        "simplicity, self-sacrifice, honor, and truth. Evil is pointed out\n" +
        "to them as being that which produces misery; good as those actions\n" +
        "which result in true happiness. Evil may be compared to poisoned\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Overcoming restlessness of body and mind by concentration techniques\n" +
        "has achieved astonishing results: it is no novelty at Ranchi to\n" +

        "an hour or more in unbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to\n" +

        "Ranchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and\n" +

        "Scriptural allegory is baffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder\n" +

        "\n" +

        "twenty-five feet across, was used, Mr Desai said, for watering\n" +
        "stock; near-by stood a revolving cement wheel for threshing rice.\n" +
        "Each of our small bedrooms proved to contain only the irreducible\n" +
        "minimum-a bed, handmade of rope. The whitewashed kitchen boasted a\n" +
        "faucet in one corner and a fire pit for cooking in another. Simple\n" +
        "Arcadian sounds reached our ears-the cries of crows and sparrows,\n" +
        "the lowing of cattle, and the rap of chisels being used to chip\n" +
        "stones.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Observing Mr Wrights travel diary, Mr Desai opened a page and\n" +
        "wrote on it a list of SATYAGRAHA vows taken by all the\n" +
        "Mahatmas strict followers (SATYAGRAHIS):\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Nonviolence; Truth; Non-Stealing; Celibacy; Non-Possession;\n" +
        "Body-Labor; Control of the Palate; Fearlessness; Equal Respect for\n" +
        "all Religions; SWADESHI (use of home manufactures); Freedom from\n" +
        "Untouchability. These eleven should be observed as vows in a spirit\n" +
        "of humility.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Two hours after our arrival my companions and I were summoned\n" +
        "to lunch. The Mahatma was already seated under the arcade of the\n" +
        "ashram porch, across the courtyard from his study. About twenty-five\n" +
        "barefooted SATYAGRAHIS were squatting before brass cups and plates.\n" +
        "A community chorus of prayer; then a meal served from large brass\n" +
        "pots containing CHAPATIS (whole-wheat unleavened bread) sprinkled\n" +
        "with GHEE; TALSARI (boiled and diced vegetables), and a lemon jam.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Mahatma ate CHAPATIS, boiled beets, some raw vegetables, and\n" +
        "oranges. On the side of his plate was a large lump of very bitter\n" +
        "NEEM leaves, a notable blood cleanser. With his spoon he separated\n" +
        "a portion and placed it on my dish. I bolted it down with water,\n" +
        "remembering childhood days when Mother had forced me to swallow the\n" +
        "disagreeable dose. Gandhi, however, bit by bit was eating the NEEM\n" +
        "paste with as much relish as if it had been a delicious sweetmeat.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In this trifling incident I noted the Mahatmas ability to detach\n" +
        "his mind from the senses at will. I recalled the famous appendectomy\n" +
        "performed on him some years ago. Refusing anesthetics, the saint\n" +
        "had chatted cheerfully with his disciples throughout the operation,\n" +
        "his infectious smile revealing his unawareness of pain.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The afternoon brought an opportunity for a chat with Gandhis noted\n" +
        "disciple, daughter of an English admiral, Miss Madeleine Slade, now\n" +
        "called Mirabai. Her strong, calm face lit with enthusiasm\n" +
        "as she told me, in flawless Hindi, of her daily activities.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rural reconstruction work is rewarding! A group of us go every\n" +
        "morning at five oclock to serve the near-by villagers and teach\n" +
        "them simple hygiene. We make it a point to clean their latrines and\n" +
        "their mud-thatched huts. The villagers are illiterate; they cannot\n" +
        "be educated except by example! She laughed gaily.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I looked in admiration at this highborn Englishwoman whose true\n" +
        "Christian humility enables her to do the scavengering work usually\n" +
        "performed only by untouchables.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I came to India in 1925, she told me. In this land I feel that\n" +

        "my old life and old interests.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We discussed America for awhile. I am always pleased and amazed,\n" +

        "by the many Americans who visit India. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mirabais hands were soon busy at the CHARKA (spinning wheel),\n" +

        "omnipresent throughout rural India.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Gandhi has sound economic and cultural reasons for encouraging the\n" +
        "revival of cottage industries, but he does not counsel a fanatical\n" +
        "repudiation of all modern progress. Machinery, trains, automobiles,\n" +
        "the telegraph have played important parts in his own colossal life!\n" +
        "Fifty years of public service, in prison and out, wrestling daily\n" +
        "with practical details and harsh realities in the political world,\n" +
        "have only increased his balance, open-mindedness, sanity, and\n" +
        "humorous appreciation of the quaint human spectacle.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our trio enjoyed a six oclock supper as guests of Babasaheb Deshmukh.\n" +
        "The 7:00 PM prayer hour found us back at the MAGANVADI ashram,\n" +
        "climbing to the roof where thirty SATYAGRAHIS were grouped in\n" +
        "a semicircle around Gandhi. He was squatting on a straw mat, an\n" +
        "ancient pocket watch propped up before him. The fading sun cast\n" +
        "a last gleam over the palms and banyans; the hum of night and the\n" +
        "crickets had started. The atmosphere was serenity itself; I was\n" +
        "enraptured.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A solemn chant led by Mr Desai, with responses from the group; then\n" +
        "a GITA reading. The Mahatma motioned to me to give the concluding\n" +
        "prayer. Such divine unison of thought and aspiration! A memory\n" +
        "forever: the Wardha roof top meditation under the early stars.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Punctually at eight oclock Gandhi ended his silence. The herculean\n" +
        "labors of his life require him to apportion his time minutely.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Welcome, Swamiji! The Mahatmas greeting this time was not via\n" +
        "paper. We had just descended from the roof to his writing room,\n" +
        "simply furnished with square mats (no chairs), a low desk with books,\n" +
        "papers, and a few ordinary pens (not fountain pens); a nondescript\n" +
        "clock ticked in a corner. An all-pervasive aura of peace and\n" +
        "devotion. Gandhi was bestowing one of his captivating, cavernous,\n" +
        "almost toothless smiles.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Years ago, he explained, I started my weekly observance\n" +
        "of a day of silence as a means for gaining time to look after my\n" +
        "correspondence. But now those twenty-four hours have become a vital\n" +
        "spiritual need. A periodical decree of silence is not a torture\n" +
        "but a blessing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I agreed wholeheartedly. The Mahatma questioned me about\n" +
        "America and Europe; we discussed India and world conditions.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mahadev, Gandhi said as Mr Desai entered the room, please\n" +
        "make arrangements at Town Hall for Swamiji to speak there on yoga\n" +
        "tomorrow night.\n" +
        "\n" +

        "\n" +
        "The Wardha mosquitoes dont know a thing about AHIMSA, \n" +

        "\n" +
        "The following morning our little group breakfasted early on a tasty\n" +
        "wheat porridge with molasses and milk. At ten-thirty we were called\n" +
        "to the ashram porch for lunch with Gandhi and the SATYAGRAHIS.\n" +
        "Today the menu included brown rice, a new selection of vegetables,\n" +
        "and cardamom seeds.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Noon found me strolling about the ashram grounds, on to the grazing\n" +
        "land of a few imperturbable cows. The protection of cows is a\n" +
        "passion with Gandhi.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The cow to me means the entire sub-human world, extending mans\n" +
        "sympathies beyond his own species, the Mahatma has explained. Man\n" +
        "through the cow is enjoined to realize his identity with all that\n" +
        "lives. Why the ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is\n" +
        "obvious to me. The cow in India was the best comparison; she was\n" +
        "the giver of plenty. Not only did she give milk, but she also made\n" +
        "agriculture possible. The cow is a poem of pity; one reads pity in\n" +
        "the gentle animal. She is the second mother to millions of mankind.\n" +
        "Protection of the cow means protection of the whole dumb creation\n" +
        "of God. The appeal of the lower order of creation is all the more\n" +
        "forceful because it is speechless.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Three daily rituals are enjoined on the orthodox Hindu. One is BHUTA\n" +
        "YAJNA, an offering of food to the animal kingdom. This ceremony\n" +
        "symbolizes mans realization of his obligations to less evolved\n" +
        "forms of creation, instinctively tied to bodily identifications which\n" +
        "also corrode human life, but lacking in that quality of liberating\n" +
        "reason which is peculiar to humanity. BHUTA YAJNA thus reinforces\n" +
        "mans readiness to succor the weak, as he in turn is comforted by\n" +
        "countless solicitudes of higher unseen beings. Man is also under\n" +
        "bond for rejuvenating gifts of nature, prodigal in earth, sea, and\n" +
        "sky. The evolutionary barrier of incommunicability among nature,\n" +
        "animals, man, and astral angels is thus overcome by offices of\n" +
        "silent love.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The other two daily YAJNAS are PITRI and NRI. PITRI YAJNA is an offering\n" +
        "of oblations to ancestors, as a symbol of mans acknowledgment of\n" +
        "his debt to the past, essence of whose wisdom illumines humanity\n" +
        "today. NRI YAJNA is an offering of food to strangers or the poor,\n" +
        "symbol of the present responsibilities of man, his duties to\n" +
        "contemporaries.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In the early afternoon I fulfilled a neighborly NRI YAJNA by a\n" +
        "visit to Gandhis ashram for little girls. Mr Wright accompanied\n" +
        "me on the ten-minute drive. Tiny young flowerlike faces atop the\n" +
        "long-stemmed colorful SARIS! At the end of a brief talk in Hindi\n" +
        " which I was giving outdoors, the skies unloosed a sudden\n" +
        "downpour. Laughing, Mr Wright and I climbed aboard the car and\n" +
        "sped back to MAGANVADI amidst sheets of driving silver. Such tropical\n" +
        "intensity and splash!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Reentering the guest house I was struck anew by the stark simplicity\n" +
        "and evidences of self-sacrifice which are everywhere present.\n" +
        "The Gandhi vow of non-possession came early in his married life.\n" +
        "Renouncing an extensive legal practice which had been yielding him\n" +

        "his wealth to the poor.\n" +

        "and enter a monastery, to what worldly sacrifice is he referring?\n" +
        "He did not renounce wealth and love; they renounced him!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Saints like Gandhi, on the other hand, have made not only tangible\n" +
        "material sacrifices, but also the more difficult renunciation of\n" +

        "and their children. Married in early youth, Gandhi and his wife\n" +
        "took the vow of celibacy after the birth of several sons. \n" +
        "A tranquil heroine in the intense drama that has been their life\n" +

        "doubtfully at the Ford. I hardly think, Swamiji, that any automobile\n" +
        "has ever penetrated into the interior as far as Biur. It might be\n" +

        "innocently playing about, pausing to stare or run wildly from\n" +

        "lazily loll beneath the trees along the roadside, curious beneath\n" +
        "their nonchalance. In one place, all the villagers were gaily\n" +
        "bathing in the large tank (in their garments, changing by draping\n" +

        "5:00 PM, we were close to our destination, Biur. This minute\n" +
        "village in the interior of Bankura District, hidden in the protection\n" +

        "\n" +
        "The road led toward a grove of date palms sheltering a group of\n" +
        "mud huts, but before we had reached it, the Ford was momentarily\n" +
        "tipped at a dangerous angle, tossed up and dropped down. The narrow\n" +
        "trail led around trees and tank, over ridges, into holes and deep\n" +
        "ruts. The car became anchored on a clump of bushes, then grounded\n" +
        "on a hillock, requiring a lift of earth clods; on we proceeded,\n" +
        "slowly and carefully; suddenly the way was stopped by a mass of\n" +
        "brush in the middle of the cart track, necessitating a detour down\n" +
        "a precipitous ledge into a dry tank, rescue from which demanded some\n" +
        "scraping, adzing, and shoveling. Again and again the road seemed\n" +
        "impassable, but the pilgrimage must go on; obliging lads fetched\n" +
        "spades and demolished the obstacles (shades of Ganesh!) while\n" +

        "women gazing wide-eyed from their hut doors, men trailing alongside\n" +
        "and behind us, children scampering to swell the procession. Ours\n" +
        "was perhaps the first auto to traverse these roads; the bullock\n" +
        "cart union must be omnipotent here! What a sensation we created-a\n" +
        "group piloted by an American and pioneering in a snorting car\n" +
        "right into their hamlet fastness, invading the ancient privacy and\n" +
        "sanctity!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Halting by a narrow lane we found ourselves within a hundred feet\n" +
        "of Giri Balas ancestral home. We felt the thrill of fulfillment\n" +
        "after the long road struggle crowned by a rough finish. We approached\n" +
        "a large, two-storied building of brick and plaster, dominating the\n" +
        "surrounding adobe huts; the house was under the process of repair,\n" +
        "for around it was the characteristically tropical framework of\n" +
        "bamboos.\n" +

        "With feverish anticipation and suppressed rejoicing we stood\n" +
        "before the open doors of the one blessed by the Lords hungerless\n" +

        "and dressed, women aloof somewhat but inquisitive too, men and\n" +

        "\n" +
        "Soon a short figure came into view in the doorway-Giri Bala! She\n" +

        "fashion, she drew forward modestly and hesitatingly, peering\n" +
        "slightly from beneath the upper fold of her SWADESHI cloth. Her\n" +
        "eyes glistened like smouldering embers in the shadow of her head\n" +
        "piece; we were enamored by a most benevolent and kindly face, a face\n" +
        "of realization and understanding, free from the taint of earthly\n" +
        "attachment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Meekly she approached and silently assented to our snapping a\n" +
        "number of pictures with our still and movie cameras. \n" +
        "Patiently and shyly she endured our photo techniques of posture\n" +
        "adjustment and light arrangement. Finally we had recorded for\n" +
        "posterity many photographs of the only woman in the world who is\n" +
        "known to have lived without food or drink for over fifty years.\n" +
        "(Therese Neumann, of course, has fasted since 1923). Most motherly\n" +
        "was Giri Balas expression as she stood before us, completely\n" +
        "covered in the loose-flowing cloth, nothing of her body visible\n" +
        "but her face with its downcast eyes, her hands, and her tiny feet.\n" +
        "A face of rare peace and innocent poise-a wide, childlike, quivering\n" +
        "lip, a feminine nose, narrow, sparkling eyes, and a wistful smile.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mr Wrights impression of Giri Bala was shared by myself; spirituality\n" +
        "enfolded her like her gently shining veil. She PRONAMED before me\n" +
        "in the customary gesture of greeting from a householder to a monk.\n" +
        "Her simple charm and quiet smile gave us a welcome beyond that of\n" +
        "honeyed oratory; forgotten was our difficult, dusty trip.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The little saint seated herself cross-legged on the verandah. Though\n" +
        "bearing the scars of age, she was not emaciated; her olive-colored\n" +
        "skin had remained clear and healthy in tone.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mother, I said in Bengali, for over twenty-five years I have\n" +

        "\n" +
        "During those years I have crossed the oceans, but I never forgot\n" +
        "my early plan to someday see you. The sublime drama that you are\n" +
        "here playing so inconspicuously should be blazoned before a world\n" +
        "that has long forgotten the inner food divine.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint lifted her eyes for a minute, smiling with serene interest.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Baba (honored father) knows best, she answered meekly.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I was happy that she had taken no offense; one never knows how\n" +
        "great yogis or yoginis will react to the thought of publicity. They\n" +
        "shun it, as a rule, wishing to pursue in silence the profound soul\n" +
        "research. An inner sanction comes to them when the proper time\n" +
        "arrives to display their lives openly for the benefit of seeking\n" +
        "minds.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "A strange pastime, I thought, for a non-eating saint!\n" +

        "Tell me, Mother, from your own lips-do you live without food?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That is true. She was silent for a few moments; her next remark\n" +
        "showed that she had been struggling with mental arithmetic. From\n" +
        "the age of twelve years four months down to my present age of\n" +
        "sixty-eight--a period of over fifty-six years--I have not eaten\n" +

        "\n" +
        "If I felt a craving for food, I would have to eat. Simply yet\n" +
        "regally she stated this axiomatic truth, one known too well by a\n" +
        "world revolving around three meals a day!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But you do eat something! My tone held a note of remonstrance.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Of course! She smiled in swift understanding.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Your nourishment derives from the finer energies of the air and\n" +

        "body through the medulla oblongata.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Baba knows. Again she acquiesced, her manner soothing and\n" +
        "unemphatic.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Mother, please tell me about your early life. It holds a deep\n" +

        "beyond the seas.\n" +

        "Giri Bala put aside her habitual reserve, relaxing into a conversational\n" +
        "mood.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So be it. Her voice was low and firm. I was born in these forest\n" +
        "regions. My childhood was unremarkable save that I was possessed\n" +
        "by an insatiable appetite. I had been betrothed in early years.\n" +

        "Child, my mother often warned me, try to control your greed.\n" +

        "nothing but eating?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The calamity she had foreseen came to pass. I was only twelve\n" +
        "when I joined my husbands people in Nawabganj. My mother-in-law\n" +
        "shamed me morning, noon, and night about my gluttonous habits.\n" +
        "Her scoldings were a blessing in disguise, however; they roused my\n" +
        "dormant spiritual tendencies. One morning her ridicule was merciless.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I shall soon prove to you, I said, stung to the quick, that I\n" +
        "shall never touch food again as long as I live.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My mother-in-law laughed in derision. So! she said, how can\n" +
        "you live without eating, when you cannot live without overeating?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This remark was unanswerable! Yet an iron resolution scaffolded\n" +
        "my spirit. In a secluded spot I sought my Heavenly Father.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Lord, I prayed incessantly, please send me a guru, one who can\n" +
        "teach me to live by Thy light and not by food.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A divine ecstasy fell over me. Led by a beatific spell, I set out\n" +
        "for the Nawabganj GHAT on the Ganges. On the way I encountered the\n" +
        "priest of my husbands family.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "He stared at me without reply. Finally he spoke in a consoling\n" +
        "manner. Child, he said, come to the temple this evening; I will\n" +
        "conduct a special VEDIC ceremony for you.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "This vague answer was not the one I was seeking; I continued toward\n" +
        "the GHAT. The morning sun pierced the waters; I purified myself in\n" +
        "the Ganges, as though for a sacred initiation. As I left the river\n" +
        "bank, my wet cloth around me, in the broad glare of day my master\n" +
        "materialized himself before me!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dear little one, he said in a voice of loving compassion, I\n" +

        "deeply touched by its very unusual nature! From today you shall\n" +
        "live by the astral light, your bodily atoms fed from the infinite\n" +
        "current.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Giri Bala fell into silence. I took Mr Wrights pencil and pad\n" +
        "and translated into English a few items for his information.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The saint resumed the tale, her gentle voice barely audible. The\n" +
        "GHAT was deserted, but my guru cast round us an aura of guarding\n" +
        "light, that no stray bathers later disturb us. He initiated me\n" +
        "into a KRIA technique which frees the body from dependence on the\n" +
        "gross food of mortals. The technique includes the use of a certain\n" +
        "MANTRA and a breathing exercise more difficult than the\n" +
        "average person could perform. No medicine or magic is involved;\n" +

        "bit by bit, the following information:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I have never had any children; many years ago I became a widow.\n" +

        "She and I hastened into the building; the man was seated on a\n" +
        "lecture platform. We soon learned that he was Swami Vivekananda of\n" +
        "India. After he had given a soul-stirring talk, I went\n" +
        "forward to meet him. He smiled on me graciously, as though we\n" +
        "were old friends. I was so young that I did not know how to give\n" +

        "\n" +

        "was indelibly written on my inmost consciousness. Years passed; no\n" +
        "teacher appeared. One night in 1925 I prayed deeply that the Lord\n" +
        "would send me my guru. A few hours later, I was awakened from sleep\n" +
        "by soft strains of melody. A band of celestial beings, carrying\n" +
        "flutes and other instruments, came before my view. After filling\n" +
        "the air with glorious music, the angels slowly vanished.\n" +

        "metaphorical. But on Christmas night, as you handed me the square\n" +
        "box by the tree, I saw, for the third time in my life, the same\n" +
        "dazzling flash of light. In another minute I was gazing on my\n" +

However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I understand it, though. Of course, I can't explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot pay out the doctors by not consulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and no one else. But still, if I don't consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad, well--let it get worse!\n" +
        "I have been going on like that for a long time--twenty years. Now I am forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was a spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on purpose!)\n" +
        "When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I sat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making anybody unhappy. I almost did succeed. For the most part they were all timid people--of course, they were petitioners. But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not endure. He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off clanking it. That happened in my youth, though.\n" +
        "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite? Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame for months after. That was my way.\n" +
        "I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was lying from spite. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. I was conscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely opposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite elements. I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let them, purposely would not let them come out. They tormented me till I was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and--sickened me, at last, how they sickened me! Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something? I am sure you are fancying that  However, I assure you I do not care if you are.\n" +
        "It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest man, neither a hero nor an insect. Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a limited creature. That is my conviction of forty years. I am forty years old now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty myself. To seventy! To eighty!  Stay, let me take breath \n" +
        "You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are mistaken in that, too. I am by no means such a mirthful person as you imagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble (and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I am--then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor. I was in the service that I might have something to eat (and solely for that reason), and when last year a distant relation left me six thousand roubles in his will I immediately retired from the service and settled down in my corner. I used to live in this corner before, but now I have settled down in it. My room is a wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the town. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors. But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not going away because  ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away.\n" +
        "But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?\n" +
        "Answer: Of himself.\n" +
        "Well, so I will talk about myself.\n" +
        "I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, why I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness--a real thorough-going illness. For man's everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and unintentional towns). It would have been quite enough, for instance, to have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men of action live. I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is more, that from ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer. But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them?\n" +
        "Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone. We will not dispute it; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is sublime and beautiful, as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that  Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more conscious I was of goodness and of all that was sublime and beautiful, the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to be so. It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last--into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one's own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.\n" +
        "And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness, that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he actually is a scoundrel. But enough. Ech, I have talked a lot of nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be explained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That is why I have taken up my pen.\n" +
        "I, for instance, have a great deal of AMOUR PROPRE. I am as suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon my word I sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it. I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment--the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one's position. And when one is slapped in the face--why then the consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face). To blame, finally, because even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been able to do anything from being magnanimous--neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to. Why should I not have made up my mind? About that in particular I want to say a few words.\n" +

Such a gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way: facing the wall, such gentlemen--that is, the direct persons and men of action--are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion, as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something tranquillising, morally soothing, final--maybe even something mysterious  but of the wall later).\n" +
        "Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et caetera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an important point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in L'HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in L'HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE. For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the years. \n" +
        "But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one's position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later--that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of it. Possibly, you will add on your own account with a grin, people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face, and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face during my life. But enough  not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you.\n" +
        "I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The impossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties and all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it, there is no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics. Just try refuting it.\n" +
        "Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a case of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall  and so on, and so on.\n" +
        "Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have not the strength.\n" +
        "As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did contain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice two makes four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! How much better it is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a card-sharper's trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the ache.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ha, ha, ha! You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next, you cry, with a laugh.\n" +
        "Well, even in toothache there is enjoyment, I answer. I had toothache for a whole month and I know there is. In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan. It is a good example, gentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans express in the first place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to your consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit disdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same while she does not. They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these mortal insults, these jeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness. I ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or third day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned on the first day, that is, not simply because he has toothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by progress and European civilisation, a man who is divorced from the soil and the national elements, as they express it now-a-days. His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha'porth of faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently, more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure. As though he would say: I am worrying you, I am lacerating your hearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you see through me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute. You do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it seems our development and our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?\n" +
        "Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am not saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I could never endure saying, Forgive me, Papa, I won't do it again, not because I am incapable of saying that--on the contrary, perhaps just because I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too. As though of design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to blame in any way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the same time I was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the time. For that one could not blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one's hands folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way. How many times it has happened to me--well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself. Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself  and it was all from ENNUI, gentlemen, all from ENNUI; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all direct persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why, just the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you did not take it in). I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause, that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know). In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left again--that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was something to say about me. Sluggard--why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best club by right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had visions of it. That sublime and beautiful weighs heavily on my mind at forty But that is at forty; then--oh, then it would have been different! I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything sublime and beautiful. I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is sublime and beautiful. I should then have turned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is sublime and beautiful. An author has written AS YOU WILL: at once I drink to the health of anyone you will because I love all that is sublime and beautiful.\n" +
        "I should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute anyone who would not show me respect. I should live at ease, I should die with dignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming! And what a good round belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that everyone would have said, looking at me: Here is an asset! Here is something real and solid! And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests, consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good? Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place, when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has acted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men, CONSCIOUSLY, that is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage. Advantage! What is advantage? And will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the advantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man's advantage, SOMETIMES, not only may, but even must, consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not advantageous. And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole principle falls into dust. What do you think--are there such cases? You laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man's advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace--and so on, and so on. So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine, too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he? But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up human advantages invariably leave out one? They don't even take it into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no greater matter, they would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list. But the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for instance  Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend! When he prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony he will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will go off on quite a different tack--that is, act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to everything  I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity--in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. Yes, but it's advantage all the same, you will retort. But excuse me, I'll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble--are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing  as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon--the Great and also the present one. Take North America--the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein. And what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations--and absolutely nothing more. And through the development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls' breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from INTENTIONAL error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it's a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world.\n" +
        "Then--this is all what you say--new economic relations will be established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the Palace of Crystal will be built. Then  In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, A PROPOS of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: I say, gentleman, hadn't we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will! That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he would be sure to find followers--such is the nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one's own interests, and sometimes one POSITIVELY OUGHT (that is my idea). One's own free unfettered choice, one's own caprice, however wild it may be, one's own fancy worked up at times to frenzy--is that very most advantageous advantage which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply INDEPENDENT choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ha! ha! ha! But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality, say what you like, you will interpose with a chuckle. Science has succeeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and what is called freedom of will is nothing else than--\n" +
        "Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was rather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows what choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing, but I remembered the teaching of science  and pulled myself up. And here you have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices--that is, an explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they develop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on, that is a real mathematical formula--then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ? What do you think? Let us reckon the chances--can such a thing happen or not?\n" +
        "H'm! you decide. Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of our advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to be SENSELESS in our desires, and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning can be really calculated--because there will some day be discovered the laws of our so-called free will--so, joking apart, there may one day be something like a table constructed of them, so that we really shall choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular way, what FREEDOM is left me, especially if I am a learned man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even  to the chemical retort, there's no help for it, we must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted without our consent.\n" +
        "Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being over-philosophical; it's the result of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can--by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid--simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage--for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important--that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason  and  and  do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual--from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that's worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man's hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages--that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it's monotonous too: it's fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last--you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?\n" +
        "You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.\n" +
        "Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not brilliant, but you know one can take everything as a joke. I am, perhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is DESIRABLE to reform man in that way? And what leads you to the conclusion that man's inclinations NEED reforming? In short, how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your supposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity. You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself. I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering--that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads, WHEREVER THEY MAY LEAD. But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is PREDESTINED to make the road, and perhaps, too, that however stupid the direct practical man may be, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead SOMEWHERE, and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is constructing? Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of LES ANIMAUX DOMESTIQUES--such as the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite a different taste. They have a marvellous edifice of that pattern which endures for ever--the ant-heap.\n" +
        "With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the ant-heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their perseverance and good sense. But man is a frivolous and incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with certainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I assure you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the police-station--and there is occupation for a week. But where can man go? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.\n" +
        "And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the normal and the positive--in other words, only what is conducive to welfare--is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively ill-bred. Whether it's good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being either. I am standing for  my caprice, and for its being guaranteed to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that. In the Palace of Crystal it is unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the good of a palace of crystal if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand. There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than nothing.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed--a palace at which one will not be able to put out one's tongue or make a long nose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one's tongue out at it even on the sly.\n" +
        "You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I answer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.\n" +
        "But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live in a mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a hen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I will not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. I will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you won't deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I can retreat into my underground hole.\n" +
        "But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don't remind me that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot put out one's tongue at it. I did not say because I am so fond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not put out one's tongue. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all desire to put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats. Then why am I made with such desires? Can I have been constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat? Can this be my whole purpose? I do not believe it.\n" +
        "But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to be kept on a curb. Though we may sit forty years underground without speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we talk and talk and talk.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do nothing! Better conscious inertia! And so hurrah for underground! Though I have said that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile, yet I should not care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall not cease envying him). No, no; anyway the underground life is more advantageous. There, at any rate, one can  Oh, but even now I am lying! I am lying because I know myself that it is not underground that is better, but something different, quite different, for which I am thirsting, but which I cannot find! Damn underground!\n" +
        "I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I myself believed in anything of what I have just written. I swear to you, gentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written that I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.\n" +
        "Then why have you written all this? you will say to me. I ought to put you underground for forty years without anything to do and then come to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached! How can a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?\n" +
        "Isn't that shameful, isn't that humiliating? you will say, perhaps, wagging your heads contemptuously. You thirst for life and try to settle the problems of life by a logical tangle. And how persistent, how insolent are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are in! You talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and are in continual alarm and apologising for them. You declare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our good opinion. You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us. You know that your witticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well satisfied with their literary value. You may, perhaps, have really suffered, but you have no respect for your own suffering. You may have sincerity, but you have no modesty; out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to publicity and ignominy. You doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last word through fear, because you have not the resolution to utter it, and only have a cowardly impudence. You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure of your ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is darkened and corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine consciousness without a pure heart. And how intrusive you are, how you insist and grimace! Lies, lies, lies!\n" +
        "Of course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is from underground. I have been for forty years listening to you through a crack under the floor. I have invented them myself, there was nothing else I could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart and it has taken a literary form.\n" +
        "But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all this and give it to you to read too? And another problem: why do I call you gentlemen, why do I address you as though you really were my readers? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor given to other people to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for that, and I don't see why I should be. But you see a fancy has occurred to me and I want to realise it at all costs. Let me explain.\n" +
        "Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. He has other matters in his mind which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. The more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind. Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember some of my early adventures. Till now I have always avoided them, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis, that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau certainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right; I quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of people who made their confessions to the public. I write only for myself, and I wish to declare once and for all that if I write as though I were addressing readers, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that form. It is a form, an empty form--I shall never have readers. I have made this plain already \n" +
        "I don't wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of my notes. I shall not attempt any system or method. I will jot things down as I remember them.\n" +
        "But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you really don't reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with yourself--and on paper too--that is, that you won't attempt any system or method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on, and so on? Why are you explaining? Why do you apologise?\n" +
        "Well, there it is, I answer.\n" +
        "There is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply that I am a coward. And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience before me in order that I may be more dignified while I write. There are perhaps thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in writing? If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not simply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on paper?\n" +
        "Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and improve my style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing. Today, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory of a distant past. It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. And yet I must get rid of it somehow. I have hundreds of such reminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and oppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I should get rid of it. Why not try?\n" +
        "Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a sort of work. They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest. Well, here is a chance for me, anyway.\n" +
        "Snow is falling today, yellow and dingy. It fell yesterday, too, and a few days ago. I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that incident which I cannot shake off now. And so let it be a story A PROPOS of the falling snow.\n" +
        "AT THAT TIME I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy, ill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with no one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more in my hole. At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer fellow, but even looked upon me--I always fancied this--with a sort of loathing. I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me fancied that he was looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly countenance. Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. Yet not one of these gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness--either about their clothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had imagined it they would not have minded--so long as their superiors did not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone. I hated my face, for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that there was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to assume a lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being abject. My face may be ugly, I thought, but let it be lofty, expressive, and, above all, EXTREMELY intelligent. But I was positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities. And what was worst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite satisfied if I could have looked intelligent. In fact, I would even have put up with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have been thought strikingly intelligent.\n" +
        "Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every time I met anyone. I even made experiments whether I could face so and so's looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly developed. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I was a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them happens to be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no consequence.\n" +
        "Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no one like me and I was unlike anyone else. I am alone and they are EVERYONE, I thought--and pondered.\n" +
        "From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.\n" +
        "The very opposite sometimes happened. It was loathsome sometimes to go to the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill. But all at once, A PROPOS of nothing, there would come a phase of scepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and I would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would reproach myself with being ROMANTIC. At one time I was unwilling to speak to anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to the length of contemplating making friends with them. All my fastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish. Who knows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had simply been affected, and got out of books. I have not decided that question even now. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played preference, drank vodka, talked of promotions. But here let me make a digression.\n" +
        "We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish transcendental romantics--German, and still more French--on whom nothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France perished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would not even have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing their transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are fools. We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That is what distinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently these transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The idea that they are is due to our realistic journalists and critics of that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or France. On the contrary, the characteristics of our romantics are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental European type, and no European standard can be applied to them. (Allow me to make use of this word romantic--an old-fashioned and much respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all). The characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, TO SEE EVERYTHING AND TO SEE IT OFTEN INCOMPARABLY MORE CLEARLY THAN OUR MOST REALISTIC MINDS SEE IT; to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve the sublime and the beautiful inviolate within them to the hour of their death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of the sublime and the beautiful. Our romantic is a man of great breadth and the greatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you. I can assure you from experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what am I saying! The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don't count, and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled somewhere out there--by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest.\n" +
        "I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly abuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it. Anyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it. Our romantic would rather go out of his mind--a thing, however, which very rarely happens--than take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is never kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as the King of Spain if he should go very mad. But it is only the thin, fair people who go out of their minds in Russia. Innumerable romantics attain later in life to considerable rank in the service. Their many-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought even in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are so many broad natures among us who never lose their ideal even in the depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their ideal, though they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart. Yes, it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue. I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished rascals (I use the term rascals affectionately), suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.\n" +
        "Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us. It is not a poor material! I do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism. But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am joking. Or perhaps it's just the contrary and you are convinced that I really think so. Anyway, gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour. And do forgive my digression.\n" +
        "I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and soon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I even gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations. That, however, only happened to me once. As a rule, I was always alone.\n" +
        "In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading. I tried to stifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external impressions. And the only external means I had was reading. Reading, of course, was a great help--exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain. But at times it bored me fearfully. One longed for movement in spite of everything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome vice of the pettiest kind. My wretched passions were acute, smarting, from my continual, sickly irritability I had hysterical impulses, with tears and convulsions. I had no resource except reading, that is, there was nothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which attracted me. I was overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving for incongruity and for contrast, and so I took to vice. I have not said all this to justify myself. But, no! I am lying. I did want to justify myself. I make that little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen. I don't want to lie. I vowed to myself I would not.\n" +
        "And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy vice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most loathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse. Already even then I had my underground world in my soul. I was fearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognised. I visited various obscure haunts.\n" +
        "One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out of the window. At other times I should have felt very much disgusted, but I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman thrown out of the window--and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern and into the billiard-room. Perhaps, I thought, I'll have a fight, too, and they'll throw me out of the window.\n" +
        "I was not drunk--but what is one to do--depression will drive a man to such a pitch of hysteria? But nothing happened. It seemed that I was not even equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away without having my fight.\n" +
        "An officer put me in my place from the first moment.\n" +
        "I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up the way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a word--without a warning or explanation--moved me from where I was standing to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me. I could have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved me without noticing me.\n" +
        "Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel--a more decent, a more LITERARY one, so to speak. I had been treated like a fly. This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little fellow. But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and I certainly would have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my mind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat.\n" +
        "I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the next night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more furtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears in my eyes--but still I did go out again. Don't imagine, though, it was cowardice made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a coward at heart, though I have always been a coward in action. Don't be in a hurry to laugh--I assure you I can explain it all.\n" +
        "Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to fight a duel! But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long extinct!) who preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol's Lieutenant Pirogov, appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would have thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any case--and they looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible, something free-thinking and French. But they were quite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.\n" +
        "I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded vanity. I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and being thrown out of the window; I should have had physical courage enough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage. What I was afraid of was that everyone present, from the insolent marker down to the lowest little stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at me and fail to understand when I began to protest and to address them in literary language. For of the point of honour--not of honour, but of the point of honour (POINT D'HONNEUR)--one cannot speak among us except in literary language. You can't allude to the point of honour in ordinary language. I was fully convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the officer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but would certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the billiard-table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window.\n" +
        "Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that. I often met that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very carefully. I am not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine not; I judge from certain signs. But I--I stared at him with spite and hatred and so it went on  for several years! My resentment grew even deeper with years. At first I began making stealthy inquiries about this officer. It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no one. But one day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I was following him at a distance, as though I were tied to him--and so I learnt his surname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he lived alone or with others, and so on--in fact, everything one could learn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with the pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the novel with relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily be recognised, but on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the OTETCHESTVENNIYA ZAPISKI. But at that time such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed. That was a great vexation to me.\n" +
        "Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At last I determined to challenge my enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, charming letter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather plainly at a duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that if the officer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his friendship. And how fine that would have been! How we should have got on together! He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I could have improved his mind with my culture, and, well  my ideas, and all sorts of things might have happened. Only fancy, this was two years after his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. But, thank God (to this day I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to him. Cold shivers run down my back when I think of what might have happened if I had sent it.\n" +
        "And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of genius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on holidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four o'clock in the afternoon. Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that was just what I wanted. I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world, a nasty, disgusting fly--more intelligent, more highly developed, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course--but a fly that was continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone. Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don't know. I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.\n" +
        "Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I spoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt even more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly on holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated over my resentment watching him and  always resentfully made way for him. It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an even footing with him.\n" +
        "Why must you invariably be the first to move aside? I kept asking myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o'clock in the morning. Why is it you and not he? There's no regulation about it; there's no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass with mutual respect.\n" +
        "But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon me! What, I thought, if I meet him and don't move on one side? What if I don't move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against him? How would that be? This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly, and I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture more vividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was delighted. This intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.\n" +
        "Of course I shall not really push him, I thought, already more good-natured in my joy. I will simply not turn aside, will run up against him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other--just as much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he pushes against me. At last I made up my mind completely. But my preparations took a great deal of time. To begin with, when I carried out my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I had to think of my get-up. In case of emergency, if, for instance, there were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the most RECHERCHE: the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the society.\n" +
        "With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at Tchurkin's a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves seemed to me both more dignified and BON TON than the lemon-coloured ones which I had contemplated at first. The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous, and I did not take the lemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer's. For this purpose I began visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive. After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar. The rest of the money--a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.\n" +
        "In this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver replaced the mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It would never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be carried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many efforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I made every preparation, I was quite determined--it seemed as though we should run into one another directly--and before I knew what I was doing I had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me. I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me determination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I was six inches from him my courage failed me. He very calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball. That night I was ill again, feverish and delirious.\n" +
        "And suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with that object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would abandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly made up my mind--I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to shoulder, against one another! I did not budge an inch and passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look round and pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst of it--he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him. I returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was delighted. I was triumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will not describe to you what happened to me three days later; if you have read my first chapter you can guess for yourself. The officer was afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years. What is the dear fellow doing now? Whom is he walking over?\n" +
        "But the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick afterwards. It was followed by remorse--I tried to drive it away; I felt too sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But I had a means of escape that reconciled everything--that was to find refuge in the sublime and the beautiful, in dreams, of course. I was a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away in my corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat. I suddenly became a hero. I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if he had called on me. I could not even picture him before me then. What were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them--it is hard to say now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed, even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had faith, hope, love. I believed blindly at such times that by some miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity--beneficent, good, and, above all, READY MADE (what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready for me)--would rise up before me--and I should come out into the light of day, almost riding a white horse and crowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost place I could not conceive for myself, and for that very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. Either to be a hero or to grovel in the mud--there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is worth noting that these attacks of the sublime and the beautiful visited me even during the period of dissipation and just at the times when I was touching the bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. On the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetising sauce. That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of agonising inward analysis, and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a significance to my dissipation--in fact, completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce. There was a certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it. What could have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all.\n" +
        "And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times in those dreams of mine! in those flights into the sublime and the beautiful; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have been superfluous. Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not merely shameful, but had in them much that was sublime and beautiful something in the Manfred style. Everyone would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on--as though you did not know all about it? You will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public after all the tears and transports which I have myself confessed. But why is it contemptible? Can you imagine that I am ashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly composed. It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet you are right--it really is vulgar and contemptible. And most contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to you. And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark now. But that's enough, or there will be no end to it; each step will be more contemptible than the last.\n" +
        "I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. To plunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one human being, actually existing. I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on Tuesday--his at-home day; so I had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a Tuesday.\n" +
        "This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five Corners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a particularly frugal and sallow appearance. He had two daughters and their aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling together. The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a colleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more than two or three visitors there, always the same. They talked about the excise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him, and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say to them or venturing to say a word. I became stupefied, several times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis; but this was pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for a time my desire to embrace all mankind.\n" +
        "I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old schoolfellow. I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg, but I did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them in the street. I believe I had transferred into the department I was in simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my hateful childhood. Curses on that school and all those terrible years of penal servitude! In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as I got out into the world. There were two or three left to whom I nodded in the street. One of them was Simonov, who had in no way been distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty I don't even suppose that he was particularly stupid. I had at one time spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not lasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was evidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid that I might take up the same tone again. I suspected that he had an aversion for me, but still I went on going to see him, not being quite certain of it.\n" +
        "And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as it was Thursday Anton Antonitch's door would be closed, I thought of Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely, to put myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year since I had last seen Simonov.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be discussing an important matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of my entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years. Evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common fly. I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all hated me. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack of success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low, going about badly dressed and so on--which seemed to them a sign of my incapacity and insignificance. But I had not expected such contempt. Simonov was positively surprised at my turning up. Even in old days he had always seemed surprised at my coming. All this disconcerted me: I sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they were saying.\n" +
        "They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of theirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a distant province. This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me too. I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody liked. I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a pretty and playful boy. He was always bad at his lessons and got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good certificate, as he had powerful interests. During his last year at school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us. He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact and the social graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the 'forties. I hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting. I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his DROIT DE SEIGNEUR, and that if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they were applauding such an insect. I got the better of him on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really complete; the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually. I remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I heard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading. Then there came other rumours--of his successes in the service. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me. I saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes. By then he was wearing shoulder-straps. He was twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient General. In three years he had gone off considerably, though he was still rather handsome and adroit. One could see that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure. They had kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.\n" +
        "Of Simonov's two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German--a little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower forms--a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov's other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way remarkable--a tall young fellow, in the army, with a cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of distant relation of Zverkov's, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.\n" +
        "Well, with seven roubles each, said Trudolyubov, twenty-one roubles between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner. Zverkov, of course, won't pay.\n" +
        "Of course not, since we are inviting him, Simonov decided.\n" +
        "Can you imagine, Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General's decorations, can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone? He will accept from delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.\n" +
        "Do we want half a dozen for the four of us? observed Trudolyubov, taking notice only of the half dozen.\n" +
        "So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at the Hotel de Paris at five o'clock tomorrow, Simonov, who had been asked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.\n" +
        "How twenty-one roubles? I asked in some agitation, with a show of being offended; if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but twenty-eight roubles.\n" +
        "It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at once and would look at me with respect.\n" +
        "Do you want to join, too? Simonov observed, with no appearance of pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me. He knew me through and through.\n" +
        "It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.\n" +
        "Why not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must own I feel hurt that you have left me out, I said, boiling over again.\n" +
        "And where were we to find you? Ferfitchkin put in roughly.\n" +
        "You never were on good terms with Zverkov, Trudolyubov added, frowning.\n" +
        "But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.\n" +
        "It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that, I retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had happened. Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I have not always been on good terms with him.\n" +
        "Oh, there's no making you out  with these refinements, Trudolyubov jeered.\n" +
        "We'll put your name down, Simonov decided, addressing me. Tomorrow at five-o'clock at the Hotel de Paris.\n" +
        "What about the money? Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating me to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.\n" +
        "That will do, said Trudolyubov, getting up. If he wants to come so much, let him.\n" +
        "But it's a private thing, between us friends, Ferfitchkin said crossly, as he, too, picked up his hat. It's not an official gathering.\n" +
        "We do not want at all, perhaps \n" +
        "They went away. Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out, Trudolyubov barely nodded. Simonov, with whom I was left TETE-A-TETE, was in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly. He did not sit down and did not ask me to.\n" +
        "H'm  yes  tomorrow, then. Will you pay your subscription now? I just ask so as to know, he muttered in embarrassment.\n" +
        "I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov fifteen roubles for ages--which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I had not paid it.\n" +
        "You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came here. I am very much vexed that I have forgotten.\n" +
        "All right, all right, that doesn't matter. You can pay tomorrow after the dinner. I simply wanted to know. Please don't\n" +
        "He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed. As he walked he began to stamp with his heels.\n" +
        "Am I keeping you? I asked, after two minutes of silence.\n" +
        "Oh! he said, starting, that is--to be truthful--yes. I have to go and see someone  not far from here, he added in an apologetic voice, somewhat abashed.\n" +
        "My goodness, why didn't you say so? I cried, seizing my cap, with an astonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have expected of myself.\n" +
        "It's close by  not two paces away, Simonov repeated, accompanying me to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all. So five o'clock, punctually, tomorrow, he called down the stairs after me. He was very glad to get rid of me. I was in a fury.\n" +
        "What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them? I wondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, for a scoundrel, a pig like that Zverkov! Of course I had better not go; of course, I must just snap my fingers at them. I am not bound in any way. I'll send Simonov a note by tomorrow's post.\n" +
        "But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go, that I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more unseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.\n" +
        "And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I had was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon, for his monthly wages. That was all I paid him--he had to keep himself.\n" +
        "Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will talk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.\n" +
        "However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.\n" +
        "That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I could not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since--they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at everyone. My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But I could not endure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave in to one another. I hated them from the first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed cynically at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves. In our school the boys' faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-looking boys came to us! In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their conversations. They had no understanding of such essential things, they took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could not help considering them inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity that drove me to it, and for God's sake do not thrust upon me your hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that I was only a dreamer, while they even then had an understanding of life. They understood nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the most obvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was just, but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great deal of it was due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an assumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated them horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any of them. They repaid me in the same way, and did not conceal their aversion for me. But by then I did not desire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely began to make all the progress I could with my studies and forced my way to the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read, and understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have a friend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and complete break with those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him immediately and repulsed him--as though all I needed him for was to win a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he was, in fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school was to give up the special job for which I had been destined so as to break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my feet. And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging off to Simonov's!\n" +
        "Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with excitement, as though it were all about to happen at once. But I believed that some radical change in my life was coming, and would inevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical change in my life were at hand. I went to the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The great thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think I am overjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such great points to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I polished my boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them from the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of his contempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to dinner in my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too, that it was very poor to think so. But this is no time for thinking: now I am in for the real thing, I thought, and my heart sank. I knew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating the facts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was already shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that scoundrel Zverkov would meet me; with what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit--and, worst of all, how paltry, UNLITERARY, commonplace it would all be. Of course, the best thing would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I should have jeered at myself ever afterwards: So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the REAL THING! On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that rabble that I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them like me--if only for my elevation of thought and unmistakable wit. They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed, while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter and humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I prayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At last my wretched little clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month's wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hotel de Paris.\n" +
        "I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive. But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o'clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know--that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes and  and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. Towards six o'clock they brought in candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment.\n" +
        "Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought--I could pay him back for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way? The very supposition made me gasp.\n" +
        "I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us, he began, lisping and drawling, which was something new. You and I seem to have seen nothing of one another. You fight shy of us. You shouldn't. We are not such terrible people as you think. Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our acquaintance.\n" +
        "And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.\n" +
        "Have you been waiting long? Trudolyubov inquired.\n" +
        "I arrived at five o'clock as you told me yesterday, I answered aloud, with an irritability that threatened an explosion.\n" +
        "Didn't you let him know that we had changed the hour? said Trudolyubov to Simonov.\n" +
        "No, I didn't. I forgot, the latter replied, with no sign of regret, and without even apologising to me he went off to order the HORS D'OEUVRE.\n" +
        "So you've been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow! Zverkov cried ironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny. That rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a puppy yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and embarrassing.\n" +
        "It isn't funny at all! I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more irritated. It wasn't my fault, but other people's. They neglected to let me know. It was  it was  it was simply absurd.\n" +
        "It's not only absurd, but something else as well, muttered Trudolyubov, naively taking my part. You are not hard enough upon it. It was simply rudeness--unintentional, of course. And how could Simonov  h'm!\n" +
        "If a trick like that had been played on me, observed Ferfitchkin, I should \n" +
        "But you should have ordered something for yourself, Zverkov interrupted, or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.\n" +
        "You will allow that I might have done that without your permission, I rapped out.\n" +
        "Let us sit down, gentlemen, cried Simonov, coming in. Everything is ready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen. You see, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you? he suddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me. Evidently he had something against me. It must have been what happened yesterday.\n" +
        "All sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on my left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin next to him, between him and Trudolyubov.\n" +
        "Tell me, are you  in a government office? Zverkov went on attending to me. Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought that he ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.\n" +
        "Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head? I thought, in a fury. In my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.\n" +
        "In the N---- office, I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.\n" +
        "And ha-ave you a go-od berth? I say, what ma-a-de you leave your original job?\n" +
        "What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job, I drawled more than he, hardly able to control myself. Ferfitchkin went off into a guffaw. Simonov looked at me ironically. Trudolyubov left off eating and began looking at me with curiosity.\n" +
        "Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.\n" +
        "And the remuneration?\n" +
        "What remuneration?\n" +
        "I mean, your sa-a-lary?\n" +
        "Why are you cross-examining me? However, I told him at once what my salary was. I turned horribly red.\n" +
        "It is not very handsome, Zverkov observed majestically.\n" +
        "Yes, you can't afford to dine at cafes on that, Ferfitchkin added insolently.\n" +
        "To my thinking it's very poor, Trudolyubov observed gravely.\n" +
        "And how thin you have grown! How you have changed! added Zverkov, with a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of insolent compassion.\n" +
        "Oh, spare his blushes, cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.\n" +
        "My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing, I broke out at last; do you hear? I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense, not at other people's--note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.\n" +
        "Wha-at? Isn't every one here dining at his own expense? You would seem to be  Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster, and looking me in the face with fury.\n" +
        "Tha-at, I answered, feeling I had gone too far, and I imagine it would be better to talk of something more intelligent.\n" +
        "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?\n" +
        "Don't disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.\n" +
        "Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh? Have you gone out of your wits in your office?\n" +
        "Enough, gentlemen, enough! Zverkov cried, authoritatively.\n" +
        "How stupid it is! muttered Simonov.\n" +
        "It really is stupid. We have met here, a company of friends, for a farewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation, said Trudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone. You invited yourself to join us, so don't disturb the general harmony.\n" +
        "Enough, enough! cried Zverkov. Give over, gentlemen, it's out of place. Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before yesterday.\n" +
        "And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had almost been married two days before. There was not a word about the marriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels and kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them. It was greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.\n" +
        "No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.\n" +
        "Good Heavens, these are not the people for me! I thought. And what a fool I have made of myself before them! I let Ferfitchkin go too far, though. The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me sit down with them. They don't understand that it's an honour to them and not to me! I've grown thinner! My clothes! Oh, damn my trousers! Zverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in. But what's the use! I must get up at once, this very minute, take my hat and simply go without a word  with contempt! And tomorrow I can send a challenge. The scoundrels! As though I cared about the seven roubles. They may think. Damn it! I don't care about the seven roubles. I'll go this minute!\n" +
        "Of course I remained. I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my discomfiture. Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My annoyance increased as the wine went to my head. I longed all at once to insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To seize the moment and show what I could do, so that they would say, He's clever, though he is absurd, and  and  in fact, damn them all!\n" +
        "I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes. But they seemed to have forgotten me altogether. They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful. Zverkov was talking all the time. I began listening. Zverkov was talking of some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love (of course, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in this affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in the hussars, who had three thousand serfs.\n" +
        "And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an appearance here tonight to see you off, I cut in suddenly.\n" +
        "For one minute every one was silent. You are drunk already. Trudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my direction. Zverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an insect. I dropped my eyes. Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with champagne.\n" +
        "Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.\n" +
        "Your health and good luck on the journey! he cried to Zverkov. To old times, to our future, hurrah!\n" +
        "They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss him. I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.\n" +
        "Why, aren't you going to drink it? roared Trudolyubov, losing patience and turning menacingly to me.\n" +
        "I want to make a speech separately, on my own account  and then I'll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.\n" +
        "Spiteful brute! muttered Simonov. I drew myself up in my chair and feverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though I did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.\n" +
        "SILENCE! cried Ferfitchkin. Now for a display of wit!\n" +
        "Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.\n" +
        "Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov, I began, let me tell you that I hate phrases, phrasemongers and men in corsets  that's the first point, and there is a second one to follow it.\n" +
        "There was a general stir.\n" +
        "The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers. Especially ribald talkers! The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty. I went on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror myself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this. I love thought, Monsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing and not  H'm  I love  But, however, why not? I will drink your health, too, Mr. Zverkov. Seduce the Circassian girls, shoot the enemies of the fatherland and  and  to your health, Monsieur Zverkov!\n" +
        "Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:\n" +
        "I am very much obliged to you. He was frightfully offended and turned pale.\n" +
        "Damn the fellow! roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the table.\n" +
        "Well, he wants a punch in the face for that, squealed Ferfitchkin.\n" +
        "We ought to turn him out, muttered Simonov.\n" +
        "Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement! cried Zverkov solemnly, checking the general indignation. I thank you all, but I can show him for myself how much value I attach to his words.\n" +
        "Mr. Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your words just now! I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.\n" +
        "A duel, you mean? Certainly, he answered. But probably I was so ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with laughter.\n" +
        "Yes, let him alone, of course! He is quite drunk, Trudolyubov said with disgust.\n" +
        "I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us, Simonov muttered again.\n" +
        "Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads, I thought to myself. I picked up the bottle  and filled my glass. No, I'd better sit on to the end, I went on thinking; you would be pleased, my friends, if I went away. Nothing will induce me to go. I'll go on sitting here and drinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don't think you of the slightest consequence. I will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a public-house and I paid my entrance money. I'll sit here and drink, for I look upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns. I'll sit here and drink  and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to  to sing  H'm!\n" +
        "But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I assumed most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak FIRST. But alas, they did not address me! And oh, how I wished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck eight, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own account. I, of course, was not invited to join them. They all sat round him on the sofa. They listened to him, almost with reverence. It was evident that they were fond of him. What for? What for? I wondered. From time to time they were moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to Shakespeare's being immortal.\n" +
        "I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up and down in front of them from eight o'clock till eleven, in the same place, from the table to the stove and back again. I walk up and down to please myself and no one can prevent me. The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am! I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as though I were not in the room. Once--only once--they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove, TAKING NO NOTICE OF THEM. But nothing came of it: they said nothing, and two minutes later they ceased to notice me again. It struck eleven.\n" +
        "Friends, cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, let us all be off now, THERE!\n" +
        "Of course, of course, the others assented. I turned sharply to Zverkov. I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my throat to put an end to it. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with perspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples.\n" +
        "Zverkov, I beg your pardon, I said abruptly and resolutely. Ferfitchkin, yours too, and everyone's, everyone's: I have insulted you all!\n" +
        "Aha! A duel is not in your line, old man, Ferfitchkin hissed venomously.\n" +
        "It sent a sharp pang to my heart.\n" +
        "No, it's not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin! I am ready to fight you tomorrow, after we are reconciled. I insist upon it, in fact, and you cannot refuse. I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel. You shall fire first and I shall fire into the air.\n" +
        "He is comforting himself, said Simonov.\n" +
        "He's simply raving, said Trudolyubov.\n" +
        "But let us pass. Why are you barring our way? What do you want? Zverkov answered disdainfully.\n" +
        "They were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been drinking heavily.\n" +
        "I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but \n" +
        "Insulted? YOU insulted ME? Understand, sir, that you never, under any circumstances, could possibly insult ME.\n" +
        "And that's enough for you. Out of the way! concluded Trudolyubov.\n" +
        "Olympia is mine, friends, that's agreed! cried Zverkov.\n" +
        "We won't dispute your right, we won't dispute your right, the others answered, laughing.\n" +
        "I stood as though spat upon. The party went noisily out of the room. Trudolyubov struck up some stupid song. Simonov remained behind for a moment to tip the waiters. I suddenly went up to him.\n" +
        "Simonov! give me six roubles! I said, with desperate resolution.\n" +
        "He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes. He, too, was drunk.\n" +
        "You don't mean you are coming with us?\n" +
        "Yes.\n" +
        "I've no money, he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out of the room.\n" +
        "I clutched at his overcoat. It was a nightmare.\n" +
        "Simonov, I saw you had money. Why do you refuse me? Am I a scoundrel? Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am asking! My whole future, my whole plans depend upon it!\n" +
        "Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.\n" +
        "Take it, if you have no sense of shame! he pronounced pitilessly, and ran to overtake them.\n" +
        "I was left for a moment alone. Disorder, the remains of dinner, a broken wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink and delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and finally the waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into my face.\n" +
        "I am going there! I cried. Either they shall all go down on their knees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the face!\n" +
        "So this is it, this is it at last--contact with real life, I muttered as I ran headlong downstairs. This is very different from the Pope's leaving Rome and going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake Como!\n" +
        "You are a scoundrel, a thought flashed through my mind, if you laugh at this now.\n" +
        "No matter! I cried, answering myself. Now everything is lost!\n" +
        "There was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference--I knew where they had gone.\n" +
        "At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough peasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were warm, snow. It was hot and steamy. The little shaggy piebald horse was also covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. I made a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.\n" +
        "No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that, I cried. But I will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. Start!\n" +
        "We set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.\n" +
        "They won't go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical--that's another ball on Lake Como. And so I am bound to slap Zverkov's face! It is my duty to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in the face. Hurry up!\n" +
        "The driver tugged at the reins.\n" +
        "As soon as I go in I'll give it him. Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface? No. I'll simply go in and give it him. They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with Olympia on the sofa. That damned Olympia! She laughed at my looks on one occasion and refused me. I'll pull Olympia's hair, pull Zverkov's ears! No, better one ear, and pull him by it round the room. Maybe they will all begin beating me and will kick me out. That's most likely, indeed. No matter! Anyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative will be mine; and by the laws of honour that is everything: he will be branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows, by nothing but a duel. He will be forced to fight. And let them beat me now. Let them, the ungrateful wretches! Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he is so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my hair. But no matter, no matter! That's what I am going for. The blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all! When they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that in reality they are not worth my little finger. Get on, driver, get on! I cried to the driver. He started and flicked his whip, I shouted so savagely.\n" +
        "We shall fight at daybreak, that's a settled thing. I've done with the office. Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now. But where can I get pistols? Nonsense! I'll get my salary in advance and buy them. And powder, and bullets? That's the second's business. And how can it all be done by daybreak? and where am I to get a second? I have no friends. Nonsense! I cried, lashing myself up more and more. It's of no consequence! The first person I meet in the street is bound to be my second, just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water. The most eccentric things may happen. Even if I were to ask the director himself to be my second tomorrow, he would be bound to consent, if only from a feeling of chivalry, and to keep the secret! Anton Antonitch.\n" +
        "The fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my plan and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to my imagination than it could be to anyone on earth. But .\n" +
        "Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!\n" +
        "Ugh, sir! said the son of toil.\n" +
        "Cold shivers suddenly ran down me. Wouldn't it be better  to go straight home? My God, my God! Why did I invite myself to this dinner yesterday? But no, it's impossible. And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove? No, they, they and no one else must pay for my walking up and down! They must wipe out this dishonour! Drive on!\n" +
        "And what if they give me into custody? They won't dare! They'll be afraid of the scandal. And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he refuses to fight a duel? He is sure to; but in that case I'll show them  I will turn up at the posting station when he's setting off tomorrow, I'll catch him by the leg, I'll pull off his coat when he gets into the carriage. I'll get my teeth into his hand, I'll bite him. See what lengths you can drive a desperate man to! He may hit me on the head and they may belabour me from behind. I will shout to the assembled multitude: Look at this young puppy who is driving off to captivate the Circassian girls after letting me spit in his face!\n" +
        "Of course, after that everything will be over! The office will have vanished off the face of the earth. I shall be arrested, I shall be tried, I shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to Siberia. Never mind! In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I will trudge off to him, a beggar, in rags. I shall find him in some provincial town. He will be married and happy. He will have a grown-up daughter. I shall say to him: Look, monster, at my hollow cheeks and my rags! I've lost everything--my career, my happiness, art, science, THE WOMAN I LOVED, and all through you. Here are pistols. I have come to discharge my pistol and  and I  forgive you. Then I shall fire into the air and he will hear nothing more of me.\n" +
        "I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at that moment that all this was out of Pushkin's SILVIO and Lermontov's MASQUERADE. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow in the middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and astonished.\n" +
        "What was I to do? I could not go on there--it was evidently stupid, and I could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as though  Heavens, how could I leave things! And after such insults! No! I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again. It is ordained! It is fate! Drive on, drive on!\n" +
        "And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck.\n" +
        "What are you up to? What are you hitting me for? the peasant shouted, but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.\n" +
        "The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless of it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap, and felt with horror that it was going to happen NOW, AT ONCE, and that NO FORCE COULD STOP IT. The deserted street lamps gleamed sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow drifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted there. I did not wrap myself up--all was lost, anyway.\n" +
        "At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps and began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak, particularly in my legs and knees. The door was opened quickly as though they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one of those millinery establishments which were abolished by the police a good time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had an introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.\n" +
        "I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room, where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement: there was no one there. Where are they? I asked somebody. But by now, of course, they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a stupid smile, the madam herself, who had seen me before. A minute later a door opened and another person came in.\n" +
        "Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I talked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here and  everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could not realise my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been smiling. I began looking at her more intently and, as it were, with effort. I had not fully collected my thoughts. There was something simple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I am sure that this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had noticed her. She could not, however, have been called a beauty, though she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very simply dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to her.\n" +
        "I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as revolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair. No matter, I am glad of it, I thought; I am glad that I shall seem repulsive to her; I like that.\n" +
        "Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though oppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it were unexpectedly rapid, chime--as though someone were suddenly jumping forward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep but lying half-conscious.\n" +
        "It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room, cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and all sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time. In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.\n" +
        "I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon me again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams moved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.\n" +
        "My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me, rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite seemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw beside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and persistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly remote; it weighed upon me.\n" +
        "A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in those two eyes, beginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those two hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea--revolting as a spider--of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation. For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable.\n" +
        "What is your name? I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.\n" +
        "Liza, she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from graciously, and she turned her eyes away.\n" +
        "I was silent.\n" +
        "What weather! The snow  it's disgusting! I said, almost to myself, putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.\n" +
        "She made no answer. This was horrible.\n" +
        "Have you always lived in Petersburg? I asked a minute later, almost angrily, turning my head slightly towards her.\n" +
        "No.\n" +
        "Where do you come from?\n" +
        "From Riga, she answered reluctantly.\n" +
        "Are you a German?\n" +
        "No, Russian.\n" +
        "Have you been here long?\n" +
        "Where?\n" +
        "In this house?\n" +
        "A fortnight.\n" +
        "She spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer distinguish her face.\n" +
        "Have you a father and mother?\n" +
        "Yes  no  I have.\n" +
        "Where are they?\n" +
        "There  in Riga.\n" +
        "What are they?\n" +
        "Oh, nothing.\n" +
        "Nothing? Why, what class are they?\n" +
        "Tradespeople.\n" +
        "Have you always lived with them?\n" +
        "Yes.\n" +
        "How old are you?\n" +
        "Twenty.\n" +
        "Why did you leave them?\n" +
        "Oh, for no reason.\n" +
        "That answer meant Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.\n" +
        "We were silent.\n" +
        "God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and dreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from my will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was hurrying to the office.\n" +
        "I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it, I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but as it were by accident.\n" +
        "A coffin?\n" +
        "Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.\n" +
        "From a cellar?\n" +
        "Not from a cellar, but a basement. Oh, you know  down below  from a house of ill-fame. It was filthy all round  Egg-shells, litter  a stench. It was loathsome.\n" +
        "Silence.\n" +
        "A nasty day to be buried, I began, simply to avoid being silent.\n" +
        "Nasty, in what way?\n" +
        "The snow, the wet. (I yawned).\n" +
        "It makes no difference, she said suddenly, after a brief silence.\n" +
        "No, it's horrid. (I yawned again). The gravediggers must have sworn at getting drenched by the snow. And there must have been water in the grave.\n" +
        "Why water in the grave? she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.\n" +
        "I suddenly began to feel provoked.\n" +
        "Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can't dig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.\n" +
        "Why?\n" +
        "Why? Why, the place is waterlogged. It's a regular marsh. So they bury them in water. I've seen it myself  many times.\n" +
        "(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had only heard stories of it).\n" +
        "Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?\n" +
        "But why should I die? she answered, as though defending herself.\n" +
        "Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead woman. She was  a girl like you. She died of consumption.\n" +
        "A wench would have died in hospital  (She knows all about it already: she said wench, not girl).\n" +
        "She was in debt to her madam, I retorted, more and more provoked by the discussion; and went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they knew her. They were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to her memory.\n" +
        "A great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound silence. She did not stir.\n" +
        "And is it better to die in a hospital?\n" +
        "Isn't it just the same? Besides, why should I die? she added irritably.\n" +
        "If not now, a little later.\n" +
        "Why a little later?\n" +
        "Why, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price. But after another year of this life you will be very different--you will go off.\n" +
        "In a year?\n" +
        "Anyway, in a year you will be worth less, I continued malignantly. You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year later--to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to a basement in the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it would be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say  and caught a chill, or something or other. It's not easy to get over an illness in your way of life. If you catch anything you may not get rid of it. And so you would die.\n" +
        "Oh, well, then I shall die, she answered, quite vindictively, and she made a quick movement.\n" +
        "But one is sorry.\n" +
        "Sorry for whom?\n" +
        "Sorry for life. Silence.\n" +
        "Have you been engaged to be married? Eh?\n" +
        "What's that to you?\n" +
        "Oh, I am not cross-examining you. It's nothing to me. Why are you so cross? Of course you may have had your own troubles. What is it to me? It's simply that I felt sorry.\n" +
        "Sorry for whom?\n" +
        "Sorry for you.\n" +
        "No need, she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint movement.\n" +
        "That incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she.\n" +
        "Why, do you think that you are on the right path?\n" +
        "I don't think anything.\n" +
        "That's what's wrong, that you don't think. Realise it while there is still time. There still is time. You are still young, good-looking; you might love, be married, be happy.\n" +
        "Not all married women are happy, she snapped out in the rude abrupt tone she had used at first.\n" +
        "Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. Infinitely better. Besides, with love one can live even without happiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives. But here what is there but  foulness? Phew!\n" +
        "I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began to feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was already longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner. Something suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared before me.\n" +
        "Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps, worse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though, I hastened, however, to say in self-defence. Besides, a man is no example for a woman. It's a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I am not anyone's slave. I come and go, and that's an end of it. I shake it off, and I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start. Yes, a slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want to break your chains afterwards, you won't be able to; you will be more and more fast in the snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I won't speak of anything else, maybe you won't understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt to your madam? There, you see, I added, though she made no answer, but only listened in silence, entirely absorbed, that's a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom. They will see to that. It's like selling your soul to the devil. And besides  perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky--how do you know--and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what is there good here? Here you and I  came together  just now and did not say one word to one another all the time, and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you. Is that loving? Is that how one human being should meet another? It's hideous, that's what it is!\n" +
        "Yes! she assented sharply and hurriedly.\n" +
        "I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this Yes. So the same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at me just before. So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts? Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness! I thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it's easy to turn a young soul like that!\n" +
        "It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.\n" +
        "She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness that she propped herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinising me. How I regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep breathing.\n" +
        "Why have you come here? I asked her, with a note of authority already in my voice.\n" +
        "Oh, I don't know.\n" +
        "But how nice it would be to be living in your father's house! It's warm and free; you have a home of your own.\n" +
        "But what if it's worse than this?\n" +
        "I must take the right tone, flashed through my mind. I may not get far with sentimentality. But it was only a momentary thought. I swear she really did interest me. Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.\n" +
        "Who denies it! I hastened to answer. Anything may happen. I am convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned against than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it's not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination.\n" +
        "A girl like me? she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.\n" +
        "Damn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was a good thing. She was silent.\n" +
        "See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from childhood, I shouldn't be what I am now. I often think that. However bad it may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not enemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they'll show their love of you. Anyway, you know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and perhaps that's why I've turned so  unfeeling.\n" +
        "I waited again. Perhaps she doesn't understand, I thought, and, indeed, it is absurd--it's moralising.\n" +
        "If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my daughter more than my sons, really, I began indirectly, as though talking of something else, to distract her attention. I must confess I blushed.\n" +
        "Why so? she asked.\n" +
        "Ah! so she was listening!\n" +
        "I don't know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her feet, he couldn't make enough of her, really. When she danced at parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I should never let my daughters marry.\n" +
        "What next? she said, with a faint smile.\n" +
        "I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss anyone else! That she should love a stranger more than her father! It's painful to imagine it. Of course, that's all nonsense, of course every father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. The one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father, you know. That is always so. So many family troubles come from that.\n" +
        "Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them honourably.\n" +
        "Ah, so that was it!\n" +
        "Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there is neither love nor God, I retorted warmly, and where there is no love, there is no sense either. There are such families, it's true, but I am not speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your own family, if you talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H'm!  that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.\n" +
        "And is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest people who live happily?\n" +
        "H'm  yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry YOU WILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. But think of the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it's the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one's husband end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them. Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves 'I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it's no sin to torment him a little now.' And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable. Then there are some women who are jealous. If he went off anywhere--I knew one such woman, she couldn't restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That's a pity. And the woman knows herself it's wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she loves--it's all through love. And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once--as though they had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer? People say it's a trial to have children. Who says that? It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know--a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband's heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother's breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, 'Look, I am biting!' Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one blames others!\n" +
        "It's by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you, I thought to myself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed crimson. What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I do then? That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my speech I really was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The silence continued. I almost nudged her.\n" +
        "Why are you-- she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and unyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced that I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.\n" +
        "What? I asked, with tender curiosity.\n" +
        "Why, you\n" +
        "What?\n" +
        "Why, you  speak somehow like a book, she said, and again there was a note of irony in her voice.\n" +
        "That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.\n" +
        "I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of me.\n" +
        "Wait a bit! I thought.\n" +
        "Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don't look at it as an outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart. Is it possible, is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with anyone. Can you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be good-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here. Though let me tell you this about it--about your present life, I mean; here though you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or not. I don't consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer hires himself as a workman, but he doesn't make a slave of himself altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of! You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that's everything, you know, it's a priceless diamond, it's a maiden's treasure, love--why, a man would be ready to give his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for love when you can have everything without love. And you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers of your own here. But you know that's simply a farce, that's simply a sham, it's just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don't believe it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you--that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your face, if he doesn't spit in it or give you a blow--though maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you up? An honest girl couldn't swallow the food, for she would know what she was being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don't rely upon your youth--all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she'll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don't expect anyone to take your part: the others, your companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won't dare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don't know how to be friendly without beating you. You don't believe that it is so hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New Year's Day, I saw a woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine o'clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her. You don't believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled--what if at that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father's house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour's son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself And that just suits your madam. Don't doubt it, that's how it is; you have sold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren't say a word. But when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then there will be nothing to get from you. What's more, they will reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you beg you won't get a drink of water without abuse: 'Whenever are you going off, you nasty hussy, you won't let us sleep with your moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.' That's true, I have heard such things said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in the cellar--in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet snow--no need to put themselves out for you--'Let her down, Vanuha; it's just like her luck--even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten the cord, you rascal.' 'It's all right as it is.' 'All right, is it? Why, she's on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never mind, throw the earth on her.' And they won't care to waste much time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern  and there your memory on earth will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from the face of the earth--as though you had never existed, never been born at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead arise, however you cry: Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world again.\n" +
        "And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in my throat myself, and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay and, bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart. I had reason to be troubled.\n" +
        "I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and rending her heart, and--and the more I was convinced of it, the more eagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as possible. It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it was not merely sport.\n" +
        "I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I could not speak except like a book. But that did not trouble me: I knew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness might be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was suddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.\n" +
        "Liza, my dear, I was wrong  forgive me, my dear, I began, but she squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the wrong thing and stopped.\n" +
        "This is my address, Liza, come to me.\n" +
        "I will come, she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.\n" +
        "But now I am going, good-bye  till we meet again.\n" +
        "I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled herself in it to her chin. As she did this she gave another sickly smile, blushed and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in haste to get away--to disappear.\n" +
        "Wait a minute, she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway, stopping me with her hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in hot haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted to show me something. As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and there was a smile on her lips--what was the meaning of it? Against my will I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that seemed to ask forgiveness for something. In fact, it was not the same face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and obstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time trustful, caressing, timid. The expression with which children look at people they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour. Her eyes were a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and capable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred.\n" +
        "Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must understand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of paper to me. Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with naive, almost childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her from a medical student or someone of that sort--a very high-flown and flowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter. I don't recall the words now, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases there was apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned. When I had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly impatient eyes fixed upon me. She fastened her eyes upon my face and waited impatiently for what I should say. In a few words, hurriedly, but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that she had been to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of very nice people, WHO KNEW NOTHING, absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so lately and it had all happened  and she hadn't made up her mind to stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt and at that party there had been the student who had danced with her all the evening. He had talked to her, and it turned out that he had known her in old days at Riga when he was a child, they had played together, but a very long time ago--and he knew her parents, but ABOUT THIS he knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion! And the day after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that letter through the friend with whom she had gone to the party  and  well, that was all.\n" +
        "She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished.\n" +
        "The poor girl was keeping that student's letter as a precious treasure, and had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me to go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely loved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less, I am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise herself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of her. I said nothing, pressed her hand and went out. I so longed to get away  I walked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes. I was exhausted, shattered, in bewilderment. But behind the bewilderment the truth was already gleaming. The loathsome truth.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth. Waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and immediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was positively amazed at my last night's SENTIMENTALITY with Liza, at all those outcries of horror and pity. To think of having such an attack of womanish hysteria, pah! I concluded. And what did I thrust my address upon her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it doesn't matter. But OBVIOUSLY, that was not now the chief and the most important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible; that was the chief business. And I was so taken up that morning that I actually forgot all about Liza.\n" +
        "First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before from Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen roubles straight off from Anton Antonitch. As luck would have it he was in the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the first asking. I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU with a swaggering air, I told him casually that the night before I had been keeping it up with some friends at the Hotel de Paris; we were giving a farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of my childhood, and you know--a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt--of course, he belongs to a good family, and has considerable means, a brilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you understand; we drank an extra 'half-dozen' and \n" +
        "And it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily, unconstrainedly and complacently.\n" +
        "On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.\n" +
        "To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly gentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and good-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I blamed myself for all that had happened. I defended myself, if I really may be allowed to defend myself, by alleging that being utterly unaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass, which I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for them at the Hotel de Paris between five and six o'clock. I begged Simonov's pardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to all the others, especially to Zverkov, whom I seemed to remember as though in a dream I had insulted. I added that I would have called upon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the face to. I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness (strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which was apparent in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave them at once to understand that I took rather an independent view of all that unpleasantness last night; that I was by no means so utterly crushed as you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look upon it. On a young hero's past no censure is cast!\n" +
        "There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it! I thought admiringly, as I read over the letter. And it's all because I am an intellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my place would not have known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as jolly as ever again, and all because I am 'a cultivated and educated man of our day.' And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine yesterday. H'm!  No, it was not the wine. I did not drink anything at all between five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to Simonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn't ashamed now. Hang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid of it.\n" +
        "I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to take it to Simonov. When he learned that there was money in the letter, Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it. Towards evening I went out for a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after yesterday. But as evening came on and the twilight grew denser, my impressions and, following them, my thoughts, grew more and more different and confused. Something was not dead within me, in the depths of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in acute depression. For the most part I jostled my way through the most crowded business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy Street and in Yusupov Garden. I always liked particularly sauntering along these streets in the dusk, just when there were crowds of working people of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces looking cross with anxiety. What I liked was just that cheap bustle, that bare prose. On this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever, I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely upset, it was just as though some crime were lying on my conscience.\n" +
        "The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed queer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as it were, especially, as it were, quite separately. Everything else I had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it all and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on this point I was not satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried only by Liza. What if she comes, I thought incessantly, well, it doesn't matter, let her come! H'm! it's horrid that she should see, for instance, how I live. Yesterday I seemed such a hero to her, while now, h'm! It's horrid, though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks like a beggar's. And I brought myself to go out to dinner in such a suit! And my American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out. And my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will see all this and she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to insult her. He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. And I, of course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall begin smiling, telling lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn't the beastliness of it that matters most! There is something more important, more loathsome, viler! Yes, viler! And to put on that dishonest lying mask again! \n" +
        "When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.\n" +
        "Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I remember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite an honourable feeling in her. Her crying was a good thing, it will have a good effect.\n" +
        "Yet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come back home, even after nine o'clock, when I calculated that Liza could not possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came back to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of torture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute.\n" +
        "Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to over-excited nerves, and, above all, as EXAGGERATED. I was always conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of it. I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong, I repeated to myself every hour. But, however, Liza will very likely come all the same, was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: She'll come, she is certain to come! I cried, running about the room, if not today, she will come tomorrow; she'll find me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure hearts! Oh, the vileness--oh, the silliness--oh, the stupidity of these 'wretched sentimental souls!' Why, how fail to understand? How could one fail to understand? \n" +
        "But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.\n" +
        "And how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how little of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic too) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my will. That's virginity, to be sure! Freshness of soil!\n" +
        "At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, to tell her all, and beg her not to come to me. But this thought stirred such wrath in me that I believed I should have crushed that damned Liza if she had chanced to be near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have spat at her, have turned her out, have struck her!\n" +
        "One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I began to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine o'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me and my talking to her. I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don't know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better than anything in the world. I am amazed, but. Liza, I say, can you imagine that I have not noticed your love? I saw it all, I divined it, but I did not dare to approach you first, because I had an influence over you and was afraid that you would force yourself, from gratitude, to respond to my love, would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which was perhaps absent, and I did not wish that  because it would be tyranny  it would be indelicate (in short, I launch off at that point into European, inexplicably lofty subtleties a la George Sand), but now, now you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure, you are good, you are my noble wife.\n" +
        "'Into my house come bold and free,\n" +
        "Its rightful mistress there to be'.\n" +
        "Then we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on. In fact, in the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my tongue at myself.\n" +
        "Besides, they won't let her out, the hussy! I thought. They don't let them go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I fancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o'clock precisely). Though she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet, and had certain rights; so, h'm! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to come!\n" +
        "It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at that time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him, especially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably. Though, indeed, he looked down upon everyone. Simply to glance at that flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers--absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that he did not get rid of me was simply that he could get wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions. What I loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or something of that sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my existence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.\n" +
        "To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was impossible. He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known where to hide my head. But I was so exasperated with everyone during those days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object to PUNISH Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that were owing him. I had for a long time--for the last two years--been intending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself airs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his wages. I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely silent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the first to speak of his wages. Then I would take the seven roubles out of a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I won't, I won't, I simply won't pay him his wages, I won't just because that is what I wish, because I am master, and it is for me to decide, because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude; but if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to him, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a whole month.\n" +
        "But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out for four days. He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there had been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by heart). He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of the house. If I held out and pretended not to notice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further tortures. All at once, A PROPOS of nothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. If I suddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but continue staring at me persistently for some seconds, then, with a peculiar compression of his lips and a most significant air, deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room. Two hours later he would come out again and again present himself before me in the same way. It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at him. So we stared at one another for two minutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours.\n" +
        "If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long, deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing completely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he wanted.\n" +
        "This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my temper and flew at him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance apart from him.\n" +
        "Stay, I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning, with one hand behind his back, to go to his room. Stay! Come back, come back, I tell you! and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned round and even looked at me with some wonder. However, he persisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me.\n" +
        "How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for? Answer!\n" +
        "After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round again.\n" +
        "Stay! I roared, running up to him, don't stir! There. Answer, now: what did you come in to look at?\n" +
        "If you have any order to give me it's my duty to carry it out, he answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another, all this with exasperating composure.\n" +
        "That's not what I am asking you about, you torturer! I shouted, turning crimson with anger. I'll tell you why you came here myself: you see, I don't give you your wages, you are so proud you don't want to bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid stares, to worry me and you have no sus-pic-ion how stupid it is--stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! \n" +
        "He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.\n" +
        "Listen, I shouted to him. Here's the money, do you see, here it is, (I took it out of the table drawer); here's the seven roubles complete, but you are not going to have it, you  are  not  going  to  have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon. Do you hear?\n" +
        "That cannot be, he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.\n" +
        "It shall be so, I said, I give you my word of honour, it shall be!\n" +
        "And there's nothing for me to beg your pardon for, he went on, as though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. Why, besides, you called me a 'torturer,' for which I can summon you at the police-station at any time for insulting behaviour.\n" +
        "Go, summon me, I roared, go at once, this very minute, this very second! You are a torturer all the same! a torturer!\n" +
        "But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud calls to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without looking round.\n" +
        "If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened, I decided inwardly. Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating slowly and violently.\n" +
        "Apollon, I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, go at once without a minute's delay and fetch the police-officer.\n" +
        "He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles and taken up some sewing. But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw.\n" +
        "At once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can't imagine what will happen.\n" +
        "You are certainly out of your mind, he observed, without even raising his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle. Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself? And as for being frightened--you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for nothing will come of it.\n" +
        "Go! I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike him in a minute.\n" +
        "But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us in perplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back to my room. There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my head against the wall and stood motionless in that position.\n" +
        "Two minutes later I heard Apollon's deliberate footsteps. There is some woman asking for you, he said, looking at me with peculiar severity. Then he stood aside and let in Liza. He would not go away, but stared at us sarcastically.\n" +
        "Go away, go away, I commanded in desperation. At that moment my clock began whirring and wheezing and struck seven.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I believe I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my ragged wadded dressing-gown--exactly as I had imagined the scene not long before in a fit of depression. After standing over us for a couple of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease. What made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion, more so, in fact, than I should have expected. At the sight of me, of course.\n" +
        "Sit down, I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I sat down on the sofa. She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me open-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once. This naivete of expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.\n" +
        "She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as usual, while instead of that, she  and I dimly felt that I should make her pay dearly for ALL THIS.\n" +
        "You have found me in a strange position, Liza, I began, stammering and knowing that this was the wrong way to begin. No, no, don't imagine anything, I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. I am not ashamed of my poverty. On the contrary, I look with pride on my poverty. I am poor but honourable. One can be poor and honourable, I muttered. However  would you like tea?\n" +
        "No, she was beginning.\n" +
        "Wait a minute.\n" +
        "I leapt up and ran to Apollon. I had to get out of the room somehow.\n" +
        "Apollon, I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the seven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist, here are your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must come to my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant. If you won't go, you'll make me a miserable man! You don't know what this woman is. This is--everything! You may be imagining something. But you don't know what that woman is! \n" +
        "Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to me or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle, which he had not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes with my arms crossed A LA NAPOLEON. My temples were moist with sweat. I was pale, I felt it. But, thank God, he must have been moved to pity, looking at me. Having threaded his needle he deliberately got up from his seat, deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his spectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over his shoulder: Shall I get a whole portion? deliberately walked out of the room. As I was going back to Liza, the thought occurred to me on the way: shouldn't I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown, no matter where, and then let happen what would?\n" +
        "I sat down again. She looked at me uneasily. For some minutes we were silent.\n" +
        "I will kill him, I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist so that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.\n" +
        "What are you saying! she cried, starting.\n" +
        "I will kill him! kill him! I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in absolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it was to be in such a frenzy. You don't know, Liza, what that torturer is to me. He is my torturer. He has gone now to fetch some rusks; he \n" +
        "And suddenly I burst into tears. It was an hysterical attack. How ashamed I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain them.\n" +
        "She was frightened.\n" +
        "What is the matter? What is wrong? she cried, fussing about me.\n" +
        "Water, give me water, over there! I muttered in a faint voice, though I was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without water and without muttering in a faint voice. But I was, what is called, PUTTING IT ON, to save appearances, though the attack was a genuine one.\n" +
        "She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment Apollon brought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace, prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had happened, and I blushed crimson. Liza looked at Apollon with positive alarm. He went out without a glance at either of us.\n" +
        "Liza, do you despise me? I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling with impatience to know what she was thinking.\n" +
        "She was confused, and did not know what to answer.\n" +
        "Drink your tea, I said to her angrily. I was angry with myself, but, of course, it was she who would have to pay for it. A horrible spite against her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have killed her. To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word to her all the time. She is the cause of it all, I thought.\n" +
        "Our silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did not touch it. I had got to the point of purposely refraining from beginning in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to begin alone. Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity. I was obstinately silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer, because I was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful stupidity, and yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.\n" +
        "I want to get away  from there altogether, she began, to break the silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought not to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as I was. My heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and unnecessary straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled all compassion in me; it even provoked me to greater venom. I did not care what happened. Another five minutes passed.\n" +
        "Perhaps I am in your way, she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was getting up.\n" +
        "But as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively trembled with spite, and at once burst out.\n" +
        "Why have you come to me, tell me that, please? I began, gasping for breath and regardless of logical connection in my words. I longed to have it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to begin. Why have you come? Answer, answer, I cried, hardly knowing what I was doing. I'll tell you, my good girl, why you have come. You've come because I talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you are soft as butter and longing for fine sentiments again. So you may as well know that I was laughing at you then. And I am laughing at you now. Why are you shuddering? Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been insulted just before, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening before me. I came to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn't succeed, I didn't find him; I had to avenge the insult on someone to get back my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on you and laughed at you. I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had been treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power. That's what it was, and you imagined I had come there on purpose to save you. Yes? You imagined that? You imagined that?\n" +
        "I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly, but I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very well indeed. And so, indeed, she did. She turned white as a handkerchief, tried to say something, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a chair as though she had been felled by an axe. And all the time afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her eyes wide open, shuddering with awful terror. The cynicism, the cynicism of my words overwhelmed her.\n" +
        "Save you! I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down the room before her. Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than you myself. Why didn't you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you that sermon: 'But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read us a sermon?' Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I wanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your hysteria--that was what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn't keep it up then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already because of the lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I want peace; yes, I'd sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you must realise that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either! Yes--you must answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am, but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to me that you don't understand a word of this! And what do I care, what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it's not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics!  What more do you want? Why do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don't you go?\n" +
        "But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to think and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in the world to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand, that I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance. What happened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more than I imagined. She understood from all this what a woman understands first of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I was myself unhappy.\n" +
        "The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by a look of sorrowful perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel and a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She was on the point of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice of my shouting: Why are you here, why don't you go away? but realised only that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides, she was so crushed, poor girl; she considered herself infinitely beneath me; how could she feel anger or resentment? She suddenly leapt up from her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands, yearning towards me, though still timid and not daring to stir. At this point there was a revulsion in my heart too. Then she suddenly rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst into tears. I, too, could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had before.\n" +
        "They won't let me  I can't be good! I managed to articulate; then I went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics. She came close to me, put her arms round me and stayed motionless in that position. But the trouble was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the loathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was I ashamed? I don't know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that she was now the heroine, while I was just a crushed and humiliated creature as she had been before me that night--four days before. And all this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on the sofa.\n" +
        "My God! surely I was not envious of her then.\n" +
        "I don't know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I cannot get on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but  there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.\n" +
        "I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner or later  and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled and flamed up in my heart  a feeling of mastery and possession. My eyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated her and how I was drawn to her at that minute! The one feeling intensified the other. It was almost like an act of vengeance. At first there was a look of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced me.\n" +
        "A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in frenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and peeped through the crack at Liza. She was sitting on the ground with her head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. But she did not go away, and that irritated me. This time she understood it all. I had insulted her finally, but  there's no need to describe it. She realised that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a fresh humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was added now a PERSONAL HATRED, born of envy. Though I do not maintain positively that she understood all this distinctly; but she certainly did fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what was worse, incapable of loving her.\n" +
        "I know I shall be told that this is incredible--but it is incredible to be as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. Why is it strange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I repeat, with me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral superiority. I have never in my life been able to imagine any other sort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking that love really consists in the right--freely given by the beloved object--to tyrannise over her.\n" +
        "Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a struggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with real life, as to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having come to me to hear fine sentiments; and did not even guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form.\n" +
        "I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room and peeping through the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably oppressed by her being here. I wanted her to disappear. I wanted peace, to be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.\n" +
        "But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as though she were unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at the screen as though to remind her. She started, sprang up, and flew to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape from me. Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked with heavy eyes at me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced, however, to KEEP UP APPEARANCES, and I turned away from her eyes.\n" +
        "Good-bye, she said, going towards the door.\n" +
        "I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and closed it again. Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the other corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway.\n" +
        "I did mean a moment since to tell a lie--to write that I did this accidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through losing my head. But I don't want to lie, and so I will say straight out that I opened her hand and put the money in it  from spite. It came into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and she was sitting behind the screen. But this I can say for certain: though I did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the heart, but came from my evil brain. This cruelty was so affected, so purposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could not even keep it up a minute--first I dashed away to avoid seeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza. I opened the door in the passage and began listening.\n" +
        "Liza! Liza! I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly. There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on the stairs.\n" +
        "Liza! I cried, more loudly.\n" +
        "No answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open heavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the stairs.\n" +
        "She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly oppressed.\n" +
        "I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and looked aimlessly before me. A minute passed, suddenly I started; straight before me on the table I saw. In short, I saw a crumpled blue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute before. It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other in the flat. So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.\n" +
        "Well! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have expected it? No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for my fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so. I could not endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress, flinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her. She could not have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the street.\n" +
        "It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling almost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as though with a pillow. There was no one in the street, no sound was to be heard. The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I ran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.\n" +
        "Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?\n" +
        "Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to entreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with indifference. But--what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her, perhaps, even tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today? Should I give her happiness? Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth? Should I not torture her?\n" +
        "I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered this.\n" +
        "And will it not be better? I mused fantastically, afterwards at home, stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever? Resentment--why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful consciousness! Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her--the feeling of insult will elevate and purify her  by hatred  h'm!  perhaps, too, by forgiveness. Will all that make things easier for her though? \n" +
        "And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which is better--cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?\n" +
        "So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain in my soul. Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could there have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that I should turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have heard nothing of her. I will add, too, that I remained for a long time afterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment and hatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.\n" +
        "Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory. I have many evil memories now, but  hadn't I better end my Notes here? I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I have felt ashamed all the time I've been writing this story; so it's hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY gathered together here, and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don't know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we  yes, I assure you  we should be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes, and don't dare to say all of us--excuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that all of us. As for what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what's more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don't even know what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men--men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man. We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are developing a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don't want to write more from Underground.\n" +

    var autobiography = "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. Jesse became the father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah. Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon. After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. \n" +
        "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, dont be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins. \n" +
        "Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, \n" +
        "and shall bring forth a son. \n" +
        "They shall call his name Immanuel; \n" +
        "which is, being interpreted, God with us. \n" +
        "Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; and didnt know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him Jesus. \n" +
        "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him. When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. They said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, \n" +
        "You Bethlehem, land of Judah, \n" +
        "are in no way least among the princes of Judah: \n" +
        "for out of you shall come forth a governor, \n" +
        "who shall shepherd my people, Israel. \n" +
        "Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him. \n" +
        "They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Being warned in a dream that they shouldnt return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. \n" +
        "Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. \n" +
        "He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I called my son. \n" +
        "Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men. Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, \n" +
        "A voice was heard in Ramah, \n" +
        "lamentation, weeping and great mourning, \n" +
        "Rachel weeping for her children; \n" +
        "she wouldnt be comforted, \n" +
        "because they are no more. \n" +
        "But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead. \n" +
        "He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: He will be called a Nazarene. \n" +
        "In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand! For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, \n" +
        "make ready the way of the Lord. \n" +
        "Make his paths straight. \n" +
        "Now John himself wore clothing made of camels hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance! Dont think to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. \n" +
        "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. \n" +
        "Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. But John would have hindered him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me? \n" +
        "But Jesus, answering, said to him, Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed him. Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. \n" +
        "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. The tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread. \n" +
        "But he answered, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. \n" +
        "Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, He will put his angels in charge of you. and, \n" +
        "On their hands they will bear you up, \n" +
        "so that you dont dash your foot against a stone. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, You shall not test the Lord, your God. \n" +
        "Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. He said to him, I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said to him, Get behind me,Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.  \n" +
        "Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him. Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, \n" +
        "toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, \n" +
        "Galilee of the Gentiles, \n" +
        "the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, \n" +
        "to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, \n" +
        "to them light has dawned. \n" +
        "From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. \n" +
        "Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. He said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men. \n" +
        "They immediately left their nets and followed him. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him. \n" +
        "Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him. \n" +
        "Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, \n" +
        " Blessed are the poor in spirit, \n" +
        "for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. \n" +
        " Blessed are those who mourn, \n" +
        "for they shall be comforted. \n" +
        " Blessed are the gentle, \n" +
        "for they shall inherit the earth. \n" +
        " Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,  \n" +
        "for they shall be filled. \n" +
        " Blessed are the merciful, \n" +
        "for they shall obtain mercy. \n" +
        " Blessed are the pure in heart, \n" +
        "for they shall see God. \n" +
        " Blessed are the peacemakers, \n" +
        "for they shall be called children of God. \n" +
        " Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake,  \n" +
        "for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. \n" +
        " Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.   Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.  \n" +
        " You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.   You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cant be hidden.   Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.   Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. \n" +
        " Dont think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didnt come to destroy, but to fulfill.   For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letteror one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.   Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.   For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. \n" +
        " You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, You shall not murder; and Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.   But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause   shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca! shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.  \n" +
        " If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,   leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.   Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.   Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny. \n" +
        " You have heard that it was said,  You shall not commit adultery;  but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.   If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.  If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. \n" +
        " It was also said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,  but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery. \n" +
        " Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,   but I tell you, dont swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;   nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.   Neither shall you swear by your head, for you cant make one hair white or black.   But let your Yes be Yes and your No be No. Whatever is more than these is of the evil one. \n" +
        " You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.  But I tell you, dont resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.   If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.   Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.   Give to him who asks you, and dont turn away him who desires to borrow from you. \n" +
        " You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor,  and hate your enemy.  But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,   that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Dont even the tax collectors do the same?   If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Dont even the tax collectors do the same?   Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. \n" +
        " Be careful that you dont do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.   Therefore when you do merciful deeds, dont sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.   But when you do merciful deeds, dont let your left hand know what your right hand does,   so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. \n" +
        " When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.   But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.   In praying, dont use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.   Therefore dont be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.   Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.   Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.   Give us today our daily bread.   Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.   Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.  \n" +
        " For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.   But if you dont forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. \n" +
        " Moreover when you fast, dont be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.   But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;   so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.  \n" +
        " Dont lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;   but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves dont break through and steal;   for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  \n" +
        " The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.   But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!  \n" +
        " No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cant serve both God and Mammon.   Therefore I tell you, dont be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isnt life more than food, and the body more than clothing?   See the birds of the sky, that they dont sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Arent you of much more value than they? \n" +
        " Which of you, by being anxious, can add one momentto his lifespan?   Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They dont toil, neither do they spin,   yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.   But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, wont he much more clothe you, you of little faith? \n" +
        " Therefore dont be anxious, saying, What will we eat?, What will we drink? or, With what will we be clothed?   For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.   But seek first Gods Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.   Therefore dont be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each days own evil is sufficient. \n" +
        " Dont judge, so that you wont be judged.   For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.   Why do you see the speck that is in your brothers eye, but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye?   Or how will you tell your brother, Let me remove the speck from your eye; and behold, the beam is in your own eye?   You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brothers eye. \n" +
        " Dont give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. \n" +
        " Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.   For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.   Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?   Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?   If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!   Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets. \n" +
        " Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.   Hownarrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it. \n" +
        " Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.   By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?   Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.   A good tree cant produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.   Every tree that doesnt grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.   Therefore by their fruits you will know them.   Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.   Many will tell me in that day, Lord, Lord, didnt we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?   Then I will tell them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity. \n" +
        " Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.   The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didnt fall, for it was founded on the rock.   Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesnt do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.   The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell—and great was its fall. \n" +
        "It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes. \n" +
        "When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean. \n" +
        "Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made clean. Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Jesus said to him, See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. \n" +
        "When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him, and saying, Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him. \n" +
        "The centurion answered, Lord, Im not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, Go, and he goes; and tell another, Come, and he comes; and tell my servant, Do this, and he does it. \n" +
        "When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Most certainly I tell you, I havent found so great a faith, not even in Israel.   I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,   but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed. His servant was healed in that hour. \n" +
        "When Jesus came into Peters house, he saw his wifes mother lying sick with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.  When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. \n" +
        "A scribe came, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. \n" +
        "Another of his disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead. \n" +
        "When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep. They came to him, and woke him up, saying, Save us, Lord! We are dying! \n" +
        "He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?  Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. \n" +
        "The men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? \n" +
        "When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,  two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. Behold, they cried out, saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time? Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. The demons begged him, saying, If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs. \n" +
        "He said to them, Go! \n" +
        "They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water. Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. \n" +
        "He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city. Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you. \n" +
        "Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes. \n" +
        "Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?   For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Get up, and walk?   But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins (then he said to the paralytic), Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house. \n" +
        "He arose and departed to his house. But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. \n" +
        "As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, Follow me. He got up and followed him. It happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners? \n" +
        "When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.   But you go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. \n" +
        "Then Johns disciples came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples dont fast? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.   No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.   Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. \n" +
        "While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live. \n" +
        "Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; for she said within herself, If I just touch his garment, I will be made well. \n" +
        "But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour. \n" +
        "When Jesus came into the rulers house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder, he said to them, Make room, because the girl isnt dead, but sleeping. \n" +
        "They were ridiculing him. But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. The report of this went out into all that land. As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, Have mercy on us, son of David! \n" +
        "When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? \n" +
        "They told him, Yes, Lord. \n" +
        "Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you. Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, See that no one knows about this. But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land. \n" +
        "As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel! \n" +
        "But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons. \n" +
        "Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.   Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest. \n" +
        "He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. \n" +
        "Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, Dont go among the Gentiles, and dont enter into any city of the Samaritans.   Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.   As you go, preach, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!   Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.   Dont take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.   Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.   Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.   As you enter into the household, greet it.   If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isnt worthy, let your peace return to you.   Whoever doesnt receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.   Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. \n" +
        " Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.   But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.   Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.   But when they deliver you up, dont be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.   For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. \n" +
        " Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.   You will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.   But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come. \n" +
        " A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.   It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!   Therefore dont be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.   What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.   Dont be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.  \n" +
        " Arent two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Fathers will,   but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.   Therefore dont be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.   Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.   But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. \n" +
        " Dont think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didnt come to send peace, but a sword.   For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.   A mans foes will be those of his own household.  He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isnt worthy of me.   He who doesnt take his cross and follow after me, isnt worthy of me.   He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.   He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.   He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward.   Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward. \n" +
        "It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him, Are you he who comes, or should we look for another? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:   the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.  Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me. \n" +
        "As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?   But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.   But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.   For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.  Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.   From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.  For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.   If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.   He who has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        " But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions   and say, We played the flute for you, and you didnt dance. We mourned for you, and you didnt lament.   For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.   The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her children. \n" +
        "Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didnt repent.  Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.   But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.   You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.   But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you. \n" +
        "At that time, Jesus answered, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.   Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.   All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him. \n" +
        " Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.   Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.   For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. \n" +
        "At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. \n" +
        "But he said to them, Havent you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;   how he entered into Gods house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?  Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?   But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.   But if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,you would not have condemned the guiltless.   For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. \n" +
        "He departed there, and went into their synagogue. And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? that they might accuse him. \n" +
        "He said to them, What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, wont he grab on to it, and lift it out?   Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day. Then he told the man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other. But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him. Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, and commanded them that they should not make him known: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; \n" +
        "my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: \n" +
        "I will put my Spirit on him. \n" +
        "He will proclaim justice to the nations. \n" +
        "He will not strive, nor shout; \n" +
        "neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets. \n" +
        "He wont break a bruised reed. \n" +
        "He wont quench a smoking flax, \n" +
        "until he leads justice to victory. \n" +
        "In his name, the nations will hope. \n" +
        "Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw. All the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David? But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons. \n" +
        "Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.   If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?   If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.   But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.   Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house. \n" +
        " He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesnt gather with me, scatters.   Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.   Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come. \n" +
        " Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.   You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.   The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things.   I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.   For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. \n" +
        "Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, Teacher, we want to see a sign from you. \n" +
        "But he answered them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.   For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.   The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.   The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.   But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesnt find it.   Then he says, I will return into my house from which I came out, and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.   Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation. \n" +
        "While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. One said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you. \n" +
        "But he answered him who spoke to him, Who is my mother? Who are my brothers? He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!   For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother. \n" +
        "On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside. Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach. He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, a farmer went out to sow.   As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.   Others fell on rocky ground, where they didnt have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.   When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.   Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.   Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.   He who has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        "The disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables? \n" +
        "He answered them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.   For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesnt have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.   Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they dont see, and hearing, they dont hear, neither do they understand.   In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,  \n" +
        "By hearing you will hear, \n" +
        "and will in no way understand; \n" +
        "Seeing you will see, \n" +
        "and will in no way perceive: \n" +
        " for this peoples heart has grown callous, \n" +
        "their ears are dull of hearing, \n" +
        "they have closed their eyes; \n" +
        "or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, \n" +
        "hear with their ears, \n" +
        "understand with their heart, \n" +
        "and should turn again; \n" +
        "and I would heal them. \n" +
        " But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.   For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didnt see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didnt hear them. \n" +
        " Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.   When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesnt understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.   What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;   yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.   What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.   What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. \n" +
        "He set another parable before them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,   but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.   But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.   The servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didnt you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from? \n" +
        " He said to them, An enemy has done this. \n" +
        "The servants asked him, Do you want us to go and gather them up?  \n" +
        " But he said, No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.   Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn. \n" +
        "He set another parable before them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;   which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches. \n" +
        "He spoke another parable to them. The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measuresof meal, until it was all leavened. \n" +
        "Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didnt speak to them, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "I will open my mouth in parables; \n" +
        "I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. \n" +
        "Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field. \n" +
        "He answered them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,   the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.   The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.   As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.   The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,   and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.   Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        " Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field. \n" +
        " Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,   who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. \n" +
        " Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,   which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.   So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,   and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things?  \n" +
        "They answered him, Yes, Lord. \n" +
        "He said to them, Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things. \n" +
        "It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works? Isnt this the carpenters son? Isnt his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? Arent all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things? They were offended by him. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house. He didnt do many mighty works there because of their unbelief. \n" +
        "At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, and said to his servants, This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him. For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife. For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her. When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. But when Herods birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. She, being prompted by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer. \n" +
        "The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother. His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. \n" +
        "Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick. When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to them, They dont need to go away. You give them something to eat. \n" +
        "They told him, We only have here five loaves and two fish. \n" +
        "He said, Bring them here to me. He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. \n" +
        "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, Its a ghost! and they cried out for fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying Cheer up! It is I! Dont be afraid. \n" +
        "Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters. \n" +
        "He said, Come! \n" +
        "Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me! \n" +
        "Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt? When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, You are truly the Son of God! \n" +
        "When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick, and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. \n" +
        "Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they dont wash their hands when they eat bread. \n" +
        "He answered them, Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?   For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother,and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.  But you say, Whoever may tell his father or his mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,   he shall not honor his father or mother. You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.   You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, \n" +
        " These people draw near to me with their mouth, \n" +
        "and honor me with their lips; \n" +
        "but their heart is far from me. \n" +
        " And in vain do they worship me, \n" +
        "teaching as doctrine rules made by men. \n" +
        "He summoned the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand.   That which enters into the mouth doesnt defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man. \n" +
        "Then the disciples came, and said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? \n" +
        "But he answered, Every plant which my heavenly Father didnt plant will be uprooted.   Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit. \n" +
        "Peter answered him, Explain the parable to us. \n" +
        "So Jesus said, Do you also still not understand?   Dont you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?   But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.   For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.   These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesnt defile the man. \n" +
        "Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon! \n" +
        "But he answered her not a word. \n" +
        "His disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us. \n" +
        "But he answered, I wasnt sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel. \n" +
        "But she came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me. \n" +
        "But he answered, It is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs. \n" +
        "But she said, Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters table. \n" +
        "Then Jesus answered her, Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour. \n" +
        "Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel. \n" +
        "Jesus summoned his disciples and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I dont want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.  \n" +
        "The disciples said to him, Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? \n" +
        "They said, Seven, and a few small fish. \n" +
        "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. \n" +
        "The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. But he answered them, When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.   In the morning, It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cant discern the signs of the times!   An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah. \n" +
        "He left them, and departed. The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. \n" +
        "They reasoned among themselves, saying, We brought no bread. \n" +
        "Jesus, perceiving it, said, Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread?   Dont you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?   Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?   How is it that you dont perceive that I didnt speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.  \n" +
        "Then they understood that he didnt tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am? \n" +
        "They said, Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. \n" +
        "He said to them, But who do you say that I am? \n" +
        "Simon Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.   I also tell you that you are Peter,and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hadeswill not prevail against it.   I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven. Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. \n" +
        "Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you. \n" +
        "But he turned, and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men. Then Jesus said to his disciples, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.   For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.   For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?   For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.   Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.  \n" +
        "After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. \n" +
        "Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, lets make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. \n" +
        "While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him. \n" +
        "When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. Jesus came and touched them and said, Get up, and dont be afraid.  Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone. As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Dont tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead. \n" +
        "His disciples asked him, saying, Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,   but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didnt recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them. Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer. \n" +
        "When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him. \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me. Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. \n" +
        "Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why werent we able to cast it out? \n" +
        "He said to them, Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.   But this kind doesnt go out except by prayer and fasting.  \n" +
        "While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,   and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.  \n" +
        "They were exceedingly sorry. When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, Doesnt your teacher pay the didrachma? He said, Yes. \n" +
        "When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers? \n" +
        "Peter said to him, From strangers. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Therefore the children are exempt.   But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.Take that, and give it to them for me and you. \n" +
        "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven? \n" +
        "Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in their midst, and said, Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.   Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.   Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,   but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.  \n" +
        " Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!   If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.   If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehennaof fire.   See that you dont despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.   For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost. \n" +
        " What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesnt he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?   If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.   Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. \n" +
        " If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.   But if he doesnt listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.   Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.   Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.   For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst. \n" +
        "Then Peter came and said to him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, I dont tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.   Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.   When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.  But because he couldnt pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.   The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!   The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. \n" +
        " But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe! \n" +
        " So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will repay you!   He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.   So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.   Then his lord called him in, and said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.   Shouldnt you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?   His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.   So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you dont each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds. \n" +
        "It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason? \n" +
        "He answered, Havent you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,  and said, For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?  So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, dont let man tear apart. \n" +
        "They asked him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her? \n" +
        "He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.   I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery. \n" +
        "His disciples said to him, If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. \n" +
        "But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.   For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it. \n" +
        "Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, Allow the little children, and dont forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these. He laid his hands on them, and departed from there. \n" +
        "Behold, one came to him and said, Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? \n" +
        "He said to him, Why do you call me good?No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.  \n" +
        "He said to him, Which ones? \n" +
        "Jesus said, You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not offer false testimony.   Honor your father and mother.And, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. \n" +
        "The young man said to him, All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions. Jesus said to his disciples, Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.   Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? \n" +
        "Looking at them, Jesus said, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. \n" +
        "Then Peter answered, Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.   Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.   But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.  \n" +
        " For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.   When he had agreed with the laborers for a denariusa day, he sent them into his vineyard.   He went out about the third hour,and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.   To them he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went their way.   Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,and did likewise.   About the eleventh hourhe went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, Why do you stand here all day idle?  \n" +
        " They said to him, Because no one has hired us. \n" +
        "He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.   When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first. \n" +
        " When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.   When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.   When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,   saying, These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!  \n" +
        " But he answered one of them, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didnt you agree with me for a denarius?   Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.   Isnt it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?   So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen. \n" +
        "As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,  Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,   and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up. \n" +
        "Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him. He said to her, What do you want? \n" +
        "She said to him, Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom. \n" +
        "But Jesus answered, You dont know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? \n" +
        "They said to him, We are able. \n" +
        "He said to them, You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father. \n" +
        "When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers. \n" +
        "But Jesus summoned them, and said, You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.   It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall beyour servant.   Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,   even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. \n" +
        "As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David! The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David! \n" +
        "Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, What do you want me to do for you? \n" +
        "They told him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. \n" +
        "Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him. \n" +
        "When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.   If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord needs them, and immediately he will send them. \n" +
        "All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, \n" +
        "Tell the daughter of Zion, \n" +
        "behold, your King comes to you, \n" +
        "humble, and riding on a donkey, \n" +
        "on a colt, the foal of a donkey. \n" +
        "The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them, and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them. A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road. The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, Hosanna  to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!  \n" +
        "When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, Who is this? The multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee. \n" +
        "Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers tables and the seats of those who sold the doves. He said to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer,but you have made it a den of robbers! \n" +
        "The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David! they were indignant, and said to him, Do you hear what these are saying? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Yes. Did you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise? \n" +
        "He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, Let there be no fruit from you forever!  \n" +
        "Immediately the fig tree withered away. When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and dont doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it would be done.   All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive. \n" +
        "When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.   The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?  \n" +
        "They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will ask us, Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet. They answered Jesus, and said, We dont know. \n" +
        "He also said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.   But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.   He answered, I will not, but afterward he changed his mind, and went.   He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, I go, sir, but he didnt go.   Which of the two did the will of his father? \n" +
        "They said to him, The first. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you.   For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didnt believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didnt even repent afterward, that you might believe him.  \n" +
        " Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.   When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.   The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.   Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.   But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.   But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, lets kill him, and seize his inheritance.   So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.   When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers? \n" +
        "They told him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the Scriptures,  \n" +
        "The stone which the builders rejected, \n" +
        "the same was made the head of the corner. \n" +
        "This was from the Lord. \n" +
        "It is marvelous in our eyes? \n" +
        " Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.   He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust. \n" +
        "When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them. When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet. \n" +
        "Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,  The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,   and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.   Again he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!   But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,   and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.   When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. \n" +
        " Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited werent worthy.   Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.   Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.   But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didnt have on wedding clothing,   and he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing? He was speechless.   Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.   For many are called, but few chosen. \n" +
        "Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you arent partial to anyone. Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? \n" +
        "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test me, you hypocrites?   Show me the tax money. \n" +
        "They brought to him a denarius. \n" +
        "He asked them, Whose is this image and inscription? \n" +
        "They said to him, Caesars. \n" +
        "Then he said to them, Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. \n" +
        "When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away. \n" +
        "On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother. Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother. In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. After them all, the woman died. In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her. \n" +
        "But Jesus answered them, You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.   For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like Gods angels in heaven.   But concerning the resurrection of the dead, havent you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,   I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. \n" +
        "When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him. Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  This is the first and great commandment.   A second likewise is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.  \n" +
        "Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?  \n" +
        "They said to him, Of David. \n" +
        "He said to them, How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, \n" +
        " The Lord said to my Lord, \n" +
        "sit on my right hand, \n" +
        "until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet? \n" +
        " If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son? \n" +
        "No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth. \n" +
        "Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples, saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses seat.   All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but dont do their works; for they say, and dont do.   For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.   But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringesof their garments,   and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,   the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called Rabbi, Rabbi by men.   But dont you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.   Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.   Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.   But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.   Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. \n" +
        " Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. \n" +
        " But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you dont enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.  Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of Gehennaas yourselves.  \n" +
        " Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.   You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?   Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?   You blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?   He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.   He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was livingin it.   He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it. \n" +
        " Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.   You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!  \n" +
        " Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.  You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also. \n" +
        " Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanness.   Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. \n" +
        " Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,   and say, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldnt have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.   Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.   Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.   You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?   Therefore behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;   that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.   Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation. \n" +
        " Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!   Behold, your house is left to you desolate.   For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! \n" +
        " Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.   But he answered them, You see all of these things, dont you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down. \n" +
        "As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Be careful that no one leads you astray.   For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will lead many astray.   You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you arent troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.   For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.   But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.   Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my names sake.   Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.   Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.   Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.   But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.   This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. \n" +
        " When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),   then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.   Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house.   Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.   But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!   Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,   for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.   Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.  \n" +
        " Then if any man tells you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, There, dont believe it.   For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones. \n" +
        " Behold, I have told you beforehand.   If therefore they tell you, Behold, he is in the wilderness, dont go out; Behold, he is in the inner rooms, dont believe it.   For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.   For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.   But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;  and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.   He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. \n" +
        " Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.   Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.   Most certainly I tell you, this generationwill not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.   Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.   But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven,but my Father only. \n" +
        " As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.   For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,   and they didnt know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.   Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;   two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.   Watch therefore, for you dont know in what hour your Lord comes.   But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.   Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you dont expect, the Son of Man will come. \n" +
        " Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?   Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.   Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.   But if that evil servant should say in his heart, My lord is delaying his coming,   and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,   the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesnt expect it, and in an hour when he doesnt know it,   and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.  \n" +
        " Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.   Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.   Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,   but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.   Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.   But at midnight there was a cry, Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!   Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.  The foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.   But the wise answered, saying, What if there isnt enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.   While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.   Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.   But he answered, Most certainly I tell you, I dont know you.   Watch therefore, for you dont know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming. \n" +
        " For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.   To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.   Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.   In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.   But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lords money. \n" +
        " Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.   He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them. \n" +
        " His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. \n" +
        " He also who got the two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.  \n" +
        " His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. \n" +
        " He also who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.   I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours. \n" +
        " But his lord answered him, You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didnt sow, and gather where I didnt scatter.   You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.   Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.   For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away.   Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n" +
        " But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.   Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.   He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.   Then the King will tell those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;   for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.   I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me. \n" +
        " Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?   When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?   When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you? \n" +
        " The King will answer them, Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.   Then he will say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;   for I was hungry, and you didnt give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;   I was a stranger, and you didnt take me in; naked, and you didnt clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didnt visit me. \n" +
        " Then they will also answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didnt help you? \n" +
        " Then he will answer them, saying, Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didnt do it to one of the least of these, you didnt do it to me.   These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. \n" +
        "It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,  You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified. \n" +
        "Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him. But they said, Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people. \n" +
        "Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. \n" +
        "However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me.   For you always have the poor with you; but you dont always have me.   For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.   Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her. \n" +
        "Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, and said, What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you? They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. \n" +
        "Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover? \n" +
        "He said, Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. \n" +
        "The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. As they were eating, he said, Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me. \n" +
        "They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, It isnt me, is it, Lord? \n" +
        "He answered, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.   The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born. \n" +
        "Judas, who betrayed him, answered, It isnt me, is it, Rabbi? \n" +
        "He said to him, You said it. \n" +
        "As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, All of you drink it,   for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.   But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Fathers Kingdom.  When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.  But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.  \n" +
        "But Peter answered him, Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. \n" +
        "Peter said to him, Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you. All of the disciples also said likewise. \n" +
        "Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, Sit here, while I go there and pray. He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. Then he said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me. \n" +
        "He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire. \n" +
        "He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, What, couldnt you watch with me for one hour?   Watch and pray, that you dont enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. \n" +
        "Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cant pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.  He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.   Arise, lets be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.  \n" +
        "While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people. Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him. Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.   Or do you think that I couldnt ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?   How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?  \n" +
        "In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didnt arrest me.   But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. \n" +
        "Then all the disciples left him, and fled. Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end. Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death; and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward, and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. \n" +
        "The high priest stood up, and said to him, Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you? But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky. \n" +
        "Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. What do you think? \n" +
        "They answered, He is worthy of death! Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you? \n" +
        "Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, You were also with Jesus, the Galilean! \n" +
        "But he denied it before them all, saying, I dont know what you are talking about. \n" +
        "When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. \n" +
        "Again he denied it with an oath, I dont know the man. \n" +
        "After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known. \n" +
        "Then he began to curse and to swear, I dont know the man! \n" +
        "Immediately the rooster crowed. Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. He went out and wept bitterly. \n" +
        "Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. \n" +
        "But they said, What is that to us? You see to it. \n" +
        "He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself. The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, Its not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood. They took counsel, and bought the potters field with them, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field was called The Field of Blood to this day. Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, \n" +
        "They took the thirty pieces of silver, \n" +
        "the price of him upon whom a price had been set, \n" +
        "whom some of the children of Israel priced, \n" +
        "and they gave them for the potters field, \n" +
        "as the Lord commanded me. \n" +
        "Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, So you say. \n" +
        "When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. Then Pilate said to him, Dont you hear how many things they testify against you? \n" +
        "He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired. They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ? For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up. \n" +
        "While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. But the governor answered them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? \n" +
        "They said, Barabbas! \n" +
        "Pilate said to them, What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ? \n" +
        "They all said to him, Let him be crucified! \n" +
        "But the governor said, Why? What evil has he done? \n" +
        "But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified! \n" +
        "So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it. \n" +
        "All the people answered, May his blood be on us, and on our children! \n" +
        "Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. Then the governors soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him. They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. \n" +
        "As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. They came to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull. They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots, and they sat and watched him there. They set up over his head the accusation against him written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. \n" +
        "Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left. Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross! \n" +
        "Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said, He saved others, but he cant save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, I am the Son of God. The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. \n" +
        "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, limasabachthani?  That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? \n" +
        "Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man is calling Elijah. \n" +
        "Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. The rest said, Let him be. Lets see whether Elijah comes to save him. \n" +
        "Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many. Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. \n" +
        "Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus disciple came. This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last deception will be worse than the first. \n" +
        "Pilate said to them, You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can. So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. \n" +
        "Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. The angel answered the women, Dont be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. Go quickly and tell his disciples, He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you. \n" +
        "They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice! \n" +
        "They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said to them, Dont be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me. \n" +
        "Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, saying, Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. If this comes to the governors ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry. So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day. \n" +
        "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted. Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.   Go,and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,   teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen. \n" +
        " \n" +
        "Mark  \n" +
        "The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in the prophets, \n" +
        "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, \n" +
        "who will prepare your way before you. \n" +
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, \n" +
        "Make ready the way of the Lord! \n" +
        "Make his paths straight! \n" +
        "John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. John was clothed with camels hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. He preached, saying, After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. \n" +
        "It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A voice came out of the sky, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. \n" +
        "Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him. \n" +
        "Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News. \n" +
        "Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men. \n" +
        "Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God! \n" +
        "Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!  \n" +
        "The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him! The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. \n" +
        "Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simons wifes mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons. All the city was gathered together at the door. He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didnt allow the demons to speak, because they knew him. \n" +
        "Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. Simon and those who were with him followed after him; and they found him, and told him, Everyone is looking for you. \n" +
        "He said to them, Lets go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason. He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. \n" +
        "A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you want to, you can make me clean. \n" +
        "Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I want to. Be made clean. When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out, and said to him, See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. \n" +
        "But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere. \n" +
        "When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house. Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you. \n" +
        "But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone? \n" +
        "Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?   Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?   But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—he said to the paralytic—  I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.  \n" +
        "He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this! \n" +
        "He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. \n" +
        "It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners? \n" +
        "When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. \n" +
        "Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples dont fast? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cant fast.   But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.   No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.   No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins. \n" +
        "It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. The Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day? \n" +
        "He said to them, Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?   How he entered into Gods house when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him? He said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.   Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath. \n" +
        "He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered. They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. He said to the man who had his hand withered, Stand up. He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill? But they were silent. When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand.  He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. \n" +
        "Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldnt press on him. For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, You are the Son of God! He sternly warned them that they should not make him known. \n" +
        "He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach, and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter; James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he called them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder; Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. \n" +
        "He came into a house. The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, He is insane. The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons. \n" +
        "He summoned them, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?   If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.   If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.   If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cant stand, but has an end.   But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.   Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;   but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin —because they said, He has an unclean spirit. \n" +
        "His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you. \n" +
        "He answered them, Who are my mother and my brothers? Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!   For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. \n" +
        "Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea. He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,  Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,   and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.   Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.   When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.   Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.   Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much. He said, Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        "When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. He said to them, To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,   that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them. \n" +
        "He said to them, Dont you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?   The farmer sows the word.   The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.   These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.   They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.   Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,   and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.   Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times. \n" +
        "He said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isnt it put on a stand?   For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.   If any man has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        "He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.   For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away from him. \n" +
        "He said, The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,   and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesnt know how.   For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.   But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come. \n" +
        "He said, How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?   Its like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,   yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow. \n" +
        "With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. Without a parable he didnt speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything. \n" +
        "On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, Lets go over to the other side. Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, Teacher, dont you care that we are dying? \n" +
        "He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith? \n" +
        "They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? \n" +
        "They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, and crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, dont torment me. For he said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!  \n" +
        "He asked him, What is your name? \n" +
        "He said to him, My name is Legion, for we are many. He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding. All the demons begged him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them. \n" +
        "At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. \n" +
        "The people came to see what it was that had happened. They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. They began to beg him to depart from their region. \n" +
        "As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. He didnt allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you. \n" +
        "He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. \n" +
        "When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, and begged him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live. \n" +
        "He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years, and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. For she said, If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well. Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. \n" +
        "Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, Who touched my clothes? \n" +
        "His disciples said to him, You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, Who touched me? \n" +
        "He looked around to see her who had done this thing. But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. \n" +
        "He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease. \n" +
        "While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue rulers house saying, Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more? \n" +
        "But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, Dont be afraid, only believe. He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. He came to the synagogue rulers house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. When he had entered in, he said to them, Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep. \n" +
        "They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying. Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi!  which means, being interpreted, Girl, I tell you, get up!  Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat. \n" +
        "He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? Isnt this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Arent his sisters here with us? They were offended at him. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house. He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them. He marveled because of their unbelief. \n" +
        "He went around the villages teaching. He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics. He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.   Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city! \n" +
        "They went out and preached that people should repent. They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him. But others said, He is Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets. But Herod, when he heard this, said, This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead. For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife, for he had married her. For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife. Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldnt, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly. \n" +
        "Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you. He swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom. \n" +
        "She went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? \n" +
        "She said, The head of John the Baptizer. \n" +
        "She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter. \n" +
        "The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didnt wish to refuse her. Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring Johns head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother. \n" +
        "When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. \n" +
        "The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught. He said to them, You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him. Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, This place is deserted, and it is late in the day. Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat. \n" +
        "But he answered them, You give them something to eat. \n" +
        "They asked him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat? \n" +
        "He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go see. \n" +
        "When they knew, they said, Five, and two fish. \n" +
        "He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all. They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. \n" +
        "Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray. \n" +
        "When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land. Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea,  and he would have passed by them, but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, Cheer up! It is I! Dont be afraid. He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled; for they hadnt understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. \n" +
        "When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was. Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well. \n" +
        "Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault. (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, dont eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. They dont eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches). The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why dont your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands? \n" +
        "He answered them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, \n" +
        "This people honors me with their lips, \n" +
        "but their heart is far from me. \n" +
        " But in vain do they worship me, \n" +
        "teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. \n" +
        " For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things. He said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.   For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother;and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.  But you say, If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;   then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,   making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this. \n" +
        "He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand.   There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.   If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear! \n" +
        "When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, Are you thus without understanding also? Dont you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside cant defile him,   because it doesnt go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods? He said, That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.   For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,   covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.   All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.  \n" +
        "From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didnt want anyone to know it, but he couldnt escape notice. For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.  \n" +
        "But she answered him, Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs. \n" +
        "He said to her, For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter. \n" +
        "She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out. \n" +
        "Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis. They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue. Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha!  that is, Be opened! Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. They were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak! \n" +
        "In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,  I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.   If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way. \n" +
        "His disciples answered him, From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place? \n" +
        "He asked them, How many loaves do you have? \n" +
        "They said, Seven. \n" +
        "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude. They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away. \n" +
        "Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha. The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him. He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation. \n" +
        "He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side. They forgot to take bread; and they didnt have more than one loaf in the boat with them. He warned them, saying, Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod. \n" +
        "They reasoned with one another, saying, Its because we have no bread. \n" +
        "Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, Why do you reason that its because you have no bread? Dont you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?   Having eyes, dont you see? Having ears, dont you hear? Dont you remember?   When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? \n" +
        "They told him, Twelve. \n" +
        " When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? \n" +
        "They told him, Seven. \n" +
        "He asked them, Dont you understand, yet? \n" +
        "He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him. He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything. \n" +
        "He looked up, and said, I see men; for I see them like trees walking. \n" +
        "Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly. He sent him away to his house, saying, Dont enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village. \n" +
        "Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, Who do men say that I am?  \n" +
        "They told him, John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets. \n" +
        "He said to them, But who do you say that I am? \n" +
        "Peter answered, You are the Christ. \n" +
        "He commanded them that they should tell no one about him. He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men. \n" +
        "He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.   For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.   For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?   For what will a man give in exchange for his life?   For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. \n" +
        "He said to them, Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power. \n" +
        "After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them. His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them. Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus. \n" +
        "Peter answered Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Lets make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. For he didnt know what to say, for they were very afraid. \n" +
        "A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son. Listen to him. \n" +
        "Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only. \n" +
        "As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant. \n" +
        "They asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? \n" +
        "He said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?   But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him. \n" +
        "Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them. Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him. He asked the scribes, What are you asking them? \n" +
        "One of the multitude answered, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they werent able. \n" +
        "He answered him, Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me. \n" +
        "They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth. \n" +
        "He asked his father, How long has it been since this has come to him? \n" +
        "He said, From childhood. Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes. \n" +
        "Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, I believe. Help my unbelief! \n" +
        "When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again! \n" +
        "Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose. \n" +
        "When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why couldnt we cast it out? He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting. \n" +
        "They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didnt want anyone to know it. For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again. \n" +
        "But they didnt understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him. \n" +
        "He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you arguing among yourselves on the way? \n" +
        "But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest. \n" +
        "He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all. He took a little child, and set him in their midst. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,  Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesnt receive me, but him who sent me. \n" +
        "John said to him, Teacher, we saw someone who doesnt follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesnt follow us. \n" +
        "But Jesus said, Dont forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.   For whoever is not against us is on our side.   For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christs, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.   Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.   If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,   where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched.   If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched—  where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched.   If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehennaof fire,   where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched.   For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.   Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.  \n" +
        "He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them. Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? \n" +
        "He answered, What did Moses command you? \n" +
        "They said, Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to them, For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.   But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.  For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,   and the two will become one flesh,so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.   What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.  \n" +
        "In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter. He said to them, Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.   If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery. \n" +
        "They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them. But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, Allow the little children to come to me! Dont forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.   Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it. He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them. \n" +
        "As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.   You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not give false testimony, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. \n" +
        "He said to him, Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth. \n" +
        "Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross. \n" +
        "But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions. Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! \n" +
        "The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!   It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, Then who can be saved? \n" +
        "Jesus, looking at them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God. \n" +
        "Peter began to tell him, Behold, we have left all, and have followed you. \n" +
        "Jesus said, Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,   but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.   But many who are first will be last; and the last first. \n" +
        "They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.  Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.   They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again. \n" +
        "James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask. \n" +
        "He said to them, What do you want me to do for you? \n" +
        "They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to them, You dont know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? \n" +
        "They said to him, We are able. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;   but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared. \n" +
        "When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John. \n" +
        "Jesus summoned them, and said to them, You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.   But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.   Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.   For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. \n" +
        "They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me! Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, You son of David, have mercy on me! \n" +
        "Jesus stood still, and said, Call him. \n" +
        "They called the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you! \n" +
        "He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus. \n" +
        "Jesus asked him, What do you want me to do for you? \n" +
        "The blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may see again. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Go your way. Your faith has made you well.  Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus on the way. \n" +
        "When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.   If anyone asks you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord needs him; and immediately he will send him back here. \n" +
        "They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him. Some of those who stood there asked them, What are you doing, untying the young donkey? They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go. \n" +
        "They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road. Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, Hosanna!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! \n" +
        "Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. \n" +
        "The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. Jesus told it, May no one ever eat fruit from you again!  and his disciples heard it. \n" +
        "They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves. He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple. He taught, saying to them, Isnt it written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers! \n" +
        "The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. \n" +
        "When evening came, he went out of the city. As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. Peter, remembering, said to him, Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Have faith in God.   For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and doesnt doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.   Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.   Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.   But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions. \n" +
        "They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him, and they began saying to him, By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.   The baptism of John—was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.  \n" +
        "They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him? If we should say, From men—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet. They answered Jesus, We dont know. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. \n" +
        "He began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.   When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.   They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.   Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.   Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.   Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, They will respect my son.   But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, lets kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.   They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.   What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.   Havent you even read this Scripture: \n" +
        "The stone which the builders rejected, \n" +
        "the same was made the head of the corner. \n" +
        " This was from the Lord, \n" +
        "it is marvelous in our eyes? \n" +
        "They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away. They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. When they had come, they asked him, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and dont defer to anyone; for you arent partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? \n" +
        "But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it. \n" +
        "They brought it. \n" +
        "He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? \n" +
        "They said to him, Caesars. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. \n" +
        "They marveled greatly at him. \n" +
        "There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a mans brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother. There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Isnt this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?   For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.   But about the dead, that they are raised; havent you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ?   He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken. \n" +
        "One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is the greatest of all? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, The greatest is, Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:   you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.This is the first commandment.   The second is like this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.There is no other commandment greater than these. \n" +
        "The scribe said to him, Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he, and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. \n" +
        "When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "No one dared ask him any question after that. Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?   For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, \n" +
        "The Lord said to my Lord, \n" +
        "Sit at my right hand, \n" +
        "until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet. \n" +
        " Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?  \n" +
        "The common people heard him gladly. In his teaching he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,   and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:   those who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation. \n" +
        "Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin. He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,   for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on. \n" +
        "As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings! \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down. \n" +
        "As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled? \n" +
        "Jesus, answering, began to tell them, Be careful that no one leads you astray.   For many will come in my name, saying, I am he! and will lead many astray. \n" +
        " When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, dont be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.   For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.   But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.   The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.   When they lead you away and deliver you up, dont be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. \n" +
        " Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.   You will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.   But when you see the abomination of desolation,spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,   and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.   Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.   But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!   Pray that your flight wont be in the winter.   For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.   Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.   Then if anyone tells you, Look, here is the Christ! or, Look, there! dont believe it.   For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.   But you watch. \n" +
        "Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.   But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,   the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.  Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.   Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky. \n" +
        " Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;   even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.   Most certainly I say to you, this generationwill not pass away until all these things happen.   Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.   But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.   Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you dont know when the time is.  \n" +
        " It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.   Watch therefore, for you dont know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;   lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.   What I tell you, I tell all: Watch. \n" +
        "It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him. For they said, Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people. \n" +
        "While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head. But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, Why has this ointment been wasted? For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,  and given to the poor. They grumbled against her. \n" +
        "But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.   For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.   She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.   Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her. \n" +
        "Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him. On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover? \n" +
        "He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,   and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?   He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there. \n" +
        "His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover. \n" +
        "When it was evening he came with the twelve. As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me. \n" +
        "They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, Surely not I? And another said, Surely not I? \n" +
        "He answered them, It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.   For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born. \n" +
        "As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat. This is my body. \n" +
        "He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. He said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.   Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God. When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.  However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.  \n" +
        "But Peter said to him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.  \n" +
        "But he spoke all the more, If I must die with you, I will not deny you. They all said the same thing. \n" +
        "They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray. He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch. \n" +
        "He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.  \n" +
        "He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Couldnt you watch one hour?   Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. \n" +
        "Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didnt know what to answer him. He came the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.   Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.  \n" +
        "Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely. When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him. They laid their hands on him, and seized him. But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?   I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didnt arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. \n" +
        "They all left him, and fled. A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him, but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him. \n" +
        "Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didnt agree with each other. Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands. Even so, their testimony did not agree. \n" +
        "The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you? But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? \n" +
        "Jesus said, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky. \n" +
        "The high priest tore his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think? They all condemned him to be worthy of death. Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, Prophesy! The officers struck him with the palms of their hands. \n" +
        "As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus! \n" +
        "But he denied it, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you are saying. He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. \n" +
        "The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, This is one of them. But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it. But he began to curse, and to swear, I dont know this man of whom you speak! The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. When he thought about that, he wept. \n" +
        "Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "He answered, So you say. \n" +
        "The chief priests accused him of many things. Pilate again asked him, Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you! \n" +
        "But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled. \n" +
        "Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews? For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. Pilate again asked them, What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "They cried out again, Crucify him! \n" +
        "Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? \n" +
        "But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him! \n" +
        "Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified. The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. They began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him. They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didnt take it. \n" +
        "Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. It was the third hour, and they crucified him. The superscription of his accusation was written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS. With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, He was numbered with transgressors. \n" +
        "Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross! \n" +
        "Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others. He cant save himself. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him. Those who were crucified with him insulted him. \n" +
        "When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? \n" +
        "Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah. \n" +
        "One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Let him be. Lets see whether Elijah comes to take him down. \n" +
        "Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God! \n" +
        "There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. \n" +
        "When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus body. Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid. \n" +
        "When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him. Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. They were saying among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us? for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back. \n" +
        "Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. He said to them, Dont be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you. \n" +
        "They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid. Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country. They went away and told it to the rest. They didnt believe them, either. \n" +
        "Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didnt believe those who had seen him after he had risen. He said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.   He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.   These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;   they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. \n" +
        "So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen. \n" +
        "Luke  \n" +
        "Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed. \n" +
        "There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. Now it happened, while he executed the priests office before God in the order of his division, according to the custom of the priests office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. \n" +
        "An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, Dont be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb. He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord. \n" +
        "Zacharias said to the angel, How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years. \n" +
        "The angel answered him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didnt believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time. \n" +
        "The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple. When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men. \n" +
        "Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary. Having come in, the angel said to her, Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women! \n" +
        "But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. The angel said to her, Dont be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom. \n" +
        "Mary said to the angel, How can this be, seeing I am a virgin? \n" +
        "The angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For everything spoken by God is possible. \n" +
        "Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word. \n" +
        "The angel departed from her. Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. It happened, when Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She called out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy! Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord! \n" +
        "Mary said, \n" +
        "My soul magnifies the Lord. \n" +
        "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, \n" +
        "for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid. \n" +
        "For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed. \n" +
        "For he who is mighty has done great things for me. \n" +
        "Holy is his name. \n" +
        "His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him. \n" +
        "He has shown strength with his arm. \n" +
        "He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. \n" +
        "He has put down princes from their thrones. \n" +
        "And has exalted the lowly. \n" +
        "He has filled the hungry with good things. \n" +
        "He has sent the rich away empty. \n" +
        "He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy, \n" +
        "As he spoke to our fathers, \n" +
        "to Abraham and his seed forever. \n" +
        "Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house. Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son. Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her. It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father. His mother answered, Not so; but he will be called John. \n" +
        "They said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name. They made signs to his father, what he would have him called. \n" +
        "He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, His name is John. \n" +
        "They all marveled. His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? The hand of the Lord was with him. His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, \n" +
        "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, \n" +
        "for he has visited and worked redemption for his people; \n" +
        "and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David \n" +
        "(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old), \n" +
        "salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us; \n" +
        "to show mercy towards our fathers, \n" +
        "to remember his holy covenant, \n" +
        "the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father, \n" +
        "to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, \n" +
        "should serve him without fear, \n" +
        "In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. \n" +
        "And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, \n" +
        "for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, \n" +
        "to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, \n" +
        "because of the tender mercy of our God, \n" +
        "whereby the dawn from on high will visit us, \n" +
        "to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; \n" +
        "to guide our feet into the way of peace. \n" +
        "The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel. \n" +
        "Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant. \n" +
        "It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth. She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. The angel said to them, Dont be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people. For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough. Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying, \n" +
        "Glory to God in the highest, \n" +
        "on earth peace, good will toward men. \n" +
        "It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, Lets go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us. They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child. All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them. \n" +
        "When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. \n" +
        "When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. \n" +
        "Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lords Christ. He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law, then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, \n" +
        "Now you are releasing your servant, Master, \n" +
        "according to your word, in peace; \n" +
        "for my eyes have seen your salvation, \n" +
        "which you have prepared before the face of all peoples; \n" +
        "a light for revelation to the nations, \n" +
        "and the glory of your people Israel. \n" +
        "Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him, and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. \n" +
        "There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didnt depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day. Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem. \n" +
        "When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. \n" +
        "When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast, and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didnt know it, but supposing him to be in the company, they went a days journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances. When they didnt find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. It happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you. \n" +
        "He said to them, Why were you looking for me? Didnt you know that I must be in my Fathers house? They didnt understand the saying which he spoke to them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. \n" +
        "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, \n" +
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, \n" +
        "Make ready the way of the Lord. \n" +
        "Make his paths straight. \n" +
        "Every valley will be filled. \n" +
        "Every mountain and hill will be brought low. \n" +
        "The crooked will become straight, \n" +
        "and the rough ways smooth. \n" +
        "All flesh will see Gods salvation. \n" +
        "He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and dont begin to say among yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones! Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire. \n" +
        "The multitudes asked him, What then must we do? \n" +
        "He answered them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise. \n" +
        "Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what must we do? \n" +
        "He said to them, Collect no more than that which is appointed to you. \n" +
        "Soldiers also asked him, saying, What about us? What must we do? \n" +
        "He said to them, Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages. \n" +
        "As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, John answered them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. \n" +
        "Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people, but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brothers  wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison. Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased. \n" +
        "Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. \n" +
        "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry. The devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. \n" +
        "The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. The devil said to him, I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want. If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Get behind me Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only. \n" +
        "He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, for it is written, \n" +
        "He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you; \n" +
        "and, \n" +
        "On their hands they will bear you up, \n" +
        "lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone. \n" +
        "Jesus answering, said to him, It has been said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God. \n" +
        "When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time. \n" +
        "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area. He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. \n" +
        "He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written, \n" +
        " The Spirit of the Lord is on me, \n" +
        "because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. \n" +
        "He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, \n" +
        "to proclaim release to the captives, \n" +
        "recovering of sight to the blind, \n" +
        "to deliver those who are crushed, \n" +
        " and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. \n" +
        "He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began to tell them, Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. \n" +
        "All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, Isnt this Josephs son? \n" +
        "He said to them, Doubtless you will tell me this parable, Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown. He said, Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.   But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.   Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.   There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian. \n" +
        "They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things. They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff. But he, passing through their midst, went his way. \n" +
        "He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day, and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God! \n" +
        "Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him!  When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. \n" +
        "Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out! News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region. \n" +
        "He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simons house. Simons mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! Rebuking them, he didnt allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. \n" +
        "When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldnt go away from them. But he said to them, I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent. He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. \n" +
        "Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. He entered into one of the boats, which was Simons, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch. \n" +
        "Simon answered him, Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net. When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord. For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. \n" +
        "Jesus said to Simon, Dont be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive. \n" +
        "When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean. \n" +
        "He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made clean. \n" +
        "Immediately the leprosy left him. He commanded him to tell no one, But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed. \n" +
        "It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. Seeing their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you. \n" +
        "The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? \n" +
        "But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?   Which is easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?   But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house. \n" +
        "Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today. \n" +
        "After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, Follow me! \n" +
        "He left everything, and rose up and followed him. Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners? Jesus answered them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.   I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  \n" +
        "They said to him, Why do Johns disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink? \n" +
        "He said to them, Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?   But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days. He also told a parable to them. No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.   No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.   But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.   No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better. \n" +
        "Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands. But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day? \n" +
        "Jesus, answering them, said, Havent you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;   how he entered into Gods house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone? He said to them, The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath. \n" +
        "It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the middle. He arose and stood. Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill? He looked around at them all, and said to the man, Stretch out your hand. He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus. \n" +
        "It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor. He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all. \n" +
        "He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, \n" +
        "Blessed are you who are poor, \n" +
        "for yours is the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        " Blessed are you who hunger now, \n" +
        "for you will be filled. \n" +
        "Blessed are you who weep now, \n" +
        "for you will laugh. \n" +
        " Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Mans sake.  \n" +
        " Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets. \n" +
        "\n" +
        " But woe to you who are rich! \n" +
        "For you have received your consolation. \n" +
        " Woe to you, you who are full now, \n" +
        "for you will be hungry. \n" +
        "Woe to you who laugh now, \n" +
        "for you will mourn and weep. \n" +
        " Woe,whenmen speak well of you, \n" +
        "for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets. \n" +
        " But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,   bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.   To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, dont withhold your coat also.   Give to everyone who asks you, and dont ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again. \n" +
        " As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.   If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.   If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.   If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.   But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. \n" +
        " Therefore be merciful, \n" +
        "even as your Father is also merciful. \n" +
        " Dont judge, \n" +
        "and you wont be judged. \n" +
        "Dont condemn, \n" +
        "and you wont be condemned. \n" +
        "Set free, \n" +
        "and you will be set free. \n" +
        " Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you. \n" +
        "He spoke a parable to them. Can the blind guide the blind? Wont they both fall into a pit?   A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.   Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye, but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye?   Or how can you tell your brother, Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye, when you yourself dont see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye.   For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit.   For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people dont gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.   The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks. \n" +
        " Why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and dont do the things which I say?   Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.   He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.   But he who hears, and doesnt do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great. \n" +
        "After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. A certain centurions servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant. When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for you to do this for him, for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us. Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, dont trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. Therefore I didnt even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, Go! and he goes; and to another, Come! and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. \n" +
        "When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel. Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. \n" +
        "It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him. Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her. When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Dont cry. He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, Young man, I tell you, arise! He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. \n" +
        "Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us! and, God has visited his people! This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region. \n" +
        "The disciples of John told him about all these things. John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another? When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who comes, or should we look for another? \n" +
        "In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight. Jesus answered them, Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.   Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me. \n" +
        "When Johns messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?   But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings courts.   But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.   This is he of whom it is written, \n" +
        "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, \n" +
        "who will prepare your way before you. \n" +
        " For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he. \n" +
        "When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with Johns baptism. But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves. \n" +
        " To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?   They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, We piped to you, and you didnt dance. We mourned, and you didnt weep.   For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.   The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!   Wisdom is justified by all her children. \n" +
        "One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisees house, and sat at the table. Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisees house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment. Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to tell you.  \n" +
        "He said, Teacher, say on. \n" +
        " A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.   When they couldnt pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most? \n" +
        "Simon answered, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. \n" +
        "He said to him, You have judged correctly. Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.   You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.   You didnt anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.   Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.  He said to her, Your sins are forgiven. \n" +
        "Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins? \n" +
        "He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.  \n" +
        "It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve, and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herods steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions. When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.  The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.   Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.   Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.   Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times. As he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear! \n" +
        "Then his disciples asked him, What does this parable mean? \n" +
        "He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.  Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.   Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.   Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.   That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.   That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience. \n" +
        " No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.   For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.   Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesnt have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has. \n" +
        "His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd. It was told him by some saying, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you. \n" +
        "But he answered them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it. \n" +
        "Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, Lets go over to the other side of the lake. So they launched out. But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. They came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are dying! He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm. He said to them, Where is your faith? Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him? They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. \n" +
        "When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didnt live in a house, but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, dont torment me! For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. \n" +
        "Jesus asked him, What is your name? \n" +
        "He said, Legion, for many demons had entered into him. They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them. The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned. When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. \n" +
        "People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,  Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you. He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. \n" +
        "It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus feet, and begged him to come into his house, for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him. A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any, came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped. Jesus said, Who touched me? \n" +
        "When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, Who touched me? \n" +
        "But Jesus said, Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me. When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. He said to her, Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace. \n" +
        "While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogues house came, saying to him, Your daughter is dead. Dont trouble the Teacher. \n" +
        "But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Dont be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed. \n" +
        "When he came to the house, he didnt allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother. All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, Dont weep. She isnt dead, but sleeping. \n" +
        "They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, Child, arise! Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done. \n" +
        "He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. He said to them, Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.   Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.   As many as dont receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them. \n" +
        "They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things? He sought to see him. The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. \n" +
        "He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida. But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing. The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place. \n" +
        "But he said to them, You give them something to eat. \n" +
        "They said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people. For they were about five thousand men. \n" +
        "He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each. They did so, and made them all sit down. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over. \n" +
        "It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am? \n" +
        "They answered, John the Baptizer, but others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again. \n" +
        "He said to them, But who do you say that I am? \n" +
        "Peter answered, The Christ of God. \n" +
        "But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one, saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. \n" +
        "He said to all, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,and follow me.   For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.   For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?   For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.   But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.  \n" +
        "It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. \n" +
        "Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. Lets make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said. \n" +
        "While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Listen to him! When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. \n" +
        "It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him. Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldnt. \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here. \n" +
        "While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. They were all astonished at the majesty of God. \n" +
        "But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,  Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men. But they didnt understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. \n" +
        "There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest. Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great. \n" +
        "John answered, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesnt follow with us. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Dont forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us. \n" +
        "It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. They didnt receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did? \n" +
        "But he turned and rebuked them, You dont know of what kind of spirit you are.   For the Son of Man didnt come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. \n" +
        "They went to another village. As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. \n" +
        "He said to another, Follow me! \n" +
        "But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "Another also said, I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house. \n" +
        "But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come. Then he said to them, The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.   Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.   Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.   Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.   If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.   Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Dont go from house to house.   Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.   Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, The Kingdom of God has come near to you.   But into whatever city you enter, and they dont receive you, go out into its streets and say,   Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.   I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city. \n" +
        " Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.   But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.   You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.   Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me. \n" +
        "The seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name! \n" +
        "He said to them, I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.   Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.   Nevertheless, dont rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. \n" +
        "In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. \n" +
        "Turning to the disciples, he said, All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him. \n" +
        "Turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,   for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didnt see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didnt hear them. \n" +
        "Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? \n" +
        "He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?  \n" +
        "He answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself. \n" +
        "He said to him, You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live. \n" +
        "But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, Who is my neighbor? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.   By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.   In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.   But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,   came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.   On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.   Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers? \n" +
        "He said, He who showed mercy on him. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise. \n" +
        "It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus feet, and heard his word. But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dont you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me. \n" +
        "Jesus answered her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,   but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her. \n" +
        "It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples. \n" +
        "He said to them, When you pray, say, \n" +
        "Our Father in heaven, \n" +
        "may your name be kept holy. \n" +
        "May your Kingdom come. \n" +
        "May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. \n" +
        " Give us day by day our daily bread. \n" +
        " Forgive us our sins, \n" +
        "for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.  \n" +
        "Bring us not into temptation, \n" +
        "but deliver us from the evil one. \n" +
        "He said to them, Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,   for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,   and he from within will answer and say, Dont bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cant get up and give it to you?   I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs. \n" +
        " I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.   For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened. \n" +
        " Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he wont give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?   Or if he asks for an egg, he wont give him a scorpion, will he?   If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him? \n" +
        "He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled. But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons. Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.   If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.   But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.   But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you. \n" +
        " When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.   But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.  \n" +
        " He that is not with me is against me. He who doesnt gather with me scatters.   The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, I will turn back to my house from which I came out.   When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.   Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. \n" +
        "It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you! \n" +
        "But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it. \n" +
        "When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.   For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.   The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.   The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here. \n" +
        " No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.   The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.   Therefore see whether the light that is in you isnt darkness.   If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light. \n" +
        "Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table. When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner. The Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.   You foolish ones, didnt he who made the outside make the inside also?   But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.   But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.   Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them dont know it. \n" +
        "One of the lawyers answered him, Teacher, in saying this you insult us also. \n" +
        "He said, Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves wont even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.   Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.   So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.   Therefore also the wisdom of God said, I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,   that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;   from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.   Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didnt enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.  \n" +
        "As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him; lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him. \n" +
        "Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.   But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.   Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. \n" +
        " I tell you, my friends, dont be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.   But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna.Yes, I tell you, fear him. \n" +
        " Arent five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.   But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore dont be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows. \n" +
        " I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;   but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.   Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.   When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, dont be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;   for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say. \n" +
        "One of the multitude said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. \n" +
        "But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you? He said to them, Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a mans life doesnt consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses. \n" +
        "He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.   He reasoned within himself, saying, What will I do, because I dont have room to store my crops?   He said, This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.   I will tell my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry. \n" +
        " But God said to him, You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?   So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. \n" +
        "He said to his disciples, Therefore I tell you, dont be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.   Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.   Consider the ravens: they dont sow, they dont reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!   Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?   If then you arent able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?   Consider the lilies, how they grow. They dont toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.   But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?   Dont seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.   For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.   But seek Gods Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.   Dont be afraid, little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.   Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which dont grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesnt fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.   For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  \n" +
        " Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.   Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.   Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.   They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.   But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.   Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you dont expect him. \n" +
        "Peter said to him, Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody? \n" +
        "The Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?   Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.   Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.   But if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,   then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isnt expecting him, and in an hour that he doesnt know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.   That servant, who knew his lords will, and didnt prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,   but he who didnt know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.  \n" +
        " I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.   But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!   Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.   For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.   They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  \n" +
        " He said to the multitudes also, When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, A shower is coming, and so it happens.   When a south wind blows, you say, There will be a scorching heat, and it happens.   You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you dont interpret this time?   Why dont you judge for yourselves what is right?   For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.   I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny. \n" +
        "Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered them, Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?   I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.   Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?   I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way. \n" +
        "He spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.   He said to the vine dresser, Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?   He answered, Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.   If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down. \n" +
        "He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up. When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity. He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God. \n" +
        "The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day! \n" +
        "Therefore the Lord answered him, You hypocrites! Doesnt each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?   Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?  \n" +
        "As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. \n" +
        "He said, What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?   It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches. \n" +
        "Again he said, To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?   It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened. \n" +
        "He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem. One said to him, Lord, are they few who are saved? \n" +
        "He said to them,  Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.   When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us! then he will answer and tell you, I dont know you or where you come from.   Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.   He will say, I tell you, I dont know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.   There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.   They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.   Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last. \n" +
        "On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you. \n" +
        "He said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.   Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it cant be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem. \n" +
        " Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!   Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!  \n" +
        "It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him. Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? \n" +
        "But they were silent. \n" +
        "He took him, and healed him, and let him go. He answered them, Which of you, if your sonor an ox fell into a well, wouldnt immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day? \n" +
        "They couldnt answer him regarding these things. \n" +
        "He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,  When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, dont sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,   and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, Make room for this person. Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.   But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, Friend, move up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.   For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. \n" +
        "He also said to the one who had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, dont call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.   But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;   and you will be blessed, because they dont have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.  \n" +
        "When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God! \n" +
        "But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.   He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, Come, for everything is ready now.   They all as one began to make excuses. \n" +
        "The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused. \n" +
        " Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused. \n" +
        " Another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cant come.  \n" +
        " That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame. \n" +
        " The servant said, Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room. \n" +
        " The lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.   For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper. \n" +
        "Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,  If anyone comes to me, and doesnt disregardhis own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cant be my disciple.   Whoever doesnt bear his own cross, and come after me, cant be my disciple.   For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesnt first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?   Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,   saying, This man began to build, and wasnt able to finish.   Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?   Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.   So therefore whoever of you who doesnt renounce all that he has, he cant be my disciple.   Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?   It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. \n" +
        "Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him. The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them. \n" +
        "He told them this parable.  Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldnt leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?   When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.   When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!   I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.   Or what woman, if she had ten drachmacoins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldnt light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?   When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.   Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting. \n" +
        "He said, A certain man had two sons.   The younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my share of your property. He divided his livelihood between them.   Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.   When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.   He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.   He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.   But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare, and Im dying with hunger!   I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.   I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants. \n" +
        " He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.   The son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. \n" +
        " But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.   Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;   for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found. They began to celebrate. \n" +
        " Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.   He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.   He said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.   But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.   But he answered his father, Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.   But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him. \n" +
        " He said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.   But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found. \n" +
        "He also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.   He called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.  \n" +
        " The manager said within himself, What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I dont have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.   I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.   Calling each one of his lords debtors to him, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?   He said, A hundred batosof oil. He said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.   Then he said to another, How much do you owe? He said, A hundred corsof wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty. \n" +
        " His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.   I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.   He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.   If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?   If you have not been faithful in that which is anothers, who will give you that which is your own?   No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You arent able to serve God and Mammon. \n" +
        "The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him. He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.   The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.   But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.   Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.  \n" +
        " Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.   A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,   and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.   It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abrahams bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.   In Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.   He cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame. \n" +
        " But Abraham said, Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.   Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us. \n" +
        " He said, I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my fathers house;   for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they wont also come into this place of torment. \n" +
        " But Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them. \n" +
        " He said, No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent. \n" +
        " He said to him, If they dont listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead. \n" +
        "He said to the disciples, It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!   It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.   Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.   If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him. \n" +
        "The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. \n" +
        "The Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.   But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, Come immediately and sit down at the table,   and will not rather tell him, Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink?   Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.   Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.  \n" +
        "It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance. They lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us! \n" +
        "When he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. It happened that as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. He fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. Jesus answered, Werent the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?   Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger? Then he said to him, Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you. \n" +
        "Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The Kingdom of God doesnt come with observation;   neither will they say, Look, here! or, Look, there! for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. \n" +
        "He said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.   They will tell you, Look, here! or Look, there! Dont go away, nor follow after them,   for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.   But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.   As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.   They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.   Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;   but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.   It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.   In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.   Remember Lots wife!   Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.   I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.   There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.   \n" +
        "They, answering, asked him, Where, Lord? \n" +
        "He said to them, Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together. \n" +
        "He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, saying, There was a judge in a certain city who didnt fear God, and didnt respect man.   A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, Defend me from my adversary!   He wouldnt for a while, but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,   yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming. \n" +
        "The Lord said, Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.   Wont God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?   I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth? \n" +
        "He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.  Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.   The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.   I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.   But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldnt even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner!   I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted. \n" +
        "They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. Jesus summoned them, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and dont hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.   Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesnt receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it. \n" +
        "A certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? \n" +
        "Jesus asked him, Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God.   You know the commandments: Dont commit adultery, Dont murder, Dont steal, Dont give false testimony, Honor your father and your mother. \n" +
        "He said, I have observed all these things from my youth up. \n" +
        "When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me. \n" +
        "But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich. \n" +
        "Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!   For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "Those who heard it said, Then who can be saved? \n" +
        "But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. \n" +
        "Peter said, Look, we have left everything, and followed you. \n" +
        "He said to them, Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of Gods sake,   who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life. \n" +
        "He took the twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.   For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.   They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again. \n" +
        "They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didnt understand the things that were said. It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant. They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. He cried out, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me! Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, You son of David, have mercy on me! \n" +
        "Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,  What do you want me to do? \n" +
        "He said, Lord, that I may see again. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.  \n" +
        "Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. \n" +
        "He entered and was passing through Jericho. There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldnt because of the crowd, because he was short. He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.  He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner. \n" +
        "Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.   For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.  \n" +
        "As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.   He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, Conduct business until I come.   But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, We dont want this man to reign over us. \n" +
        " It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.   The first came before him, saying, Lord, your mina has made ten more minas. \n" +
        " He said to him, Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.  \n" +
        " The second came, saying, Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.  \n" +
        " So he said to him, And you are to be over five cities.   Another came, saying, Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,   for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didnt lay down, and reap that which you didnt sow. \n" +
        " He said to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didnt lay down, and reaping that which I didnt sow.   Then why didnt you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?   He said to those who stood by, Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas. \n" +
        " They said to him, Lord, he has ten minas!   For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.   But bring those enemies of mine who didnt want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me. Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. \n" +
        "It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, saying, Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.   If anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? say to him: The Lord needs it. \n" +
        "Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt? They said, The Lord needs it. They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them. As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road. As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen, saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!  Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest! \n" +
        "Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples! \n" +
        "He answered them, I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out. \n" +
        "When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it, saying, If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.   For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,   and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didnt know the time of your visitation. \n" +
        "He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers!  \n" +
        "He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him. They couldnt find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said. \n" +
        "It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders. They asked him, Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority? \n" +
        "He answered them, I also will ask you one question. Tell me:   the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? \n" +
        "They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why didnt you believe him? But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. They answered that they didnt know where it was from. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. \n" +
        "He began to tell the people this parable. A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.   At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.   He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.   He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.   The lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him. \n" +
        " But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, lets kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.   They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?   He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. \n" +
        "When they heard it, they said, May it never be! \n" +
        "But he looked at them, and said, Then what is this that is written, \n" +
        "The stone which the builders rejected, \n" +
        "the same was made the chief cornerstone? \n" +
        " Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces,  \n" +
        "but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust. \n" +
        "The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them. They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor. They asked him, Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and arent partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? \n" +
        "But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why do you test me?   Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?  \n" +
        "They answered, Caesars. \n" +
        "He said to them, Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. \n" +
        "They werent able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent. Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection. They asked him, Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother. There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless. The second took her as wife, and he died childless. The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died. Afterward the woman also died. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.   But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.   For they cant die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.   But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.   Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him. \n" +
        "Some of the scribes answered, Teacher, you speak well. They didnt dare to ask him any more questions. \n" +
        "He said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is Davids son?   David himself says in the book of Psalms, \n" +
        "The Lord said to my Lord, \n" +
        "Sit at my right hand, \n" +
        " until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.  \n" +
        " David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son? \n" +
        "In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,  Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;   who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation. \n" +
        "He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury. He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins. He said, Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,   for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on. \n" +
        "As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,  As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down. \n" +
        "They asked him, Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen? \n" +
        "He said, Watch out that you dont get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is at hand. Therefore dont follow them.   When you hear of wars and disturbances, dont be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end wont come immediately. \n" +
        "Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.   There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.   But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake.   It will turn out as a testimony for you.   Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,   for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.   You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.   You will be hated by all men for my names sake.   And not a hair of your head will perish. \n" +
        " By your endurance you will win your lives. \n" +
        " But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.   Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.   For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.   Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.   They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.   There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;   men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.   Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.   But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near. \n" +
        "He told them a parable. See the fig tree, and all the trees.   When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.   Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.   Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.   Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away. \n" +
        " So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.   For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.   Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man. \n" +
        "Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet. All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him. \n" +
        "Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near. The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people. Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve. He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. They were glad, and agreed to give him money. He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude. The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat. \n" +
        "They said to him, Where do you want us to prepare? \n" +
        "He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.   Tell the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?   He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there. \n" +
        "They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles. He said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,   for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and share it among yourselves,   for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes. \n" +
        "He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me. Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.   But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.   The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed! \n" +
        "They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing. There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest. He said to them, The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.   But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.   For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isnt it he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.   But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.   I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,   that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n" +
        "The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,   but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldnt fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers. \n" +
        "He said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death! \n" +
        "He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times. \n" +
        "He said to them, When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything? \n" +
        "They said, Nothing. \n" +
        "Then he said to them, But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.   For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: He was counted with transgressors. For that which concerns me has an end. \n" +
        "They said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. \n" +
        "He said to them, That is enough. \n" +
        "He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. When he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you dont enter into temptation. \n" +
        "He was withdrawn from them about a stones throw, and he knelt down and prayed, saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done. \n" +
        "An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. \n" +
        "When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief, and said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation. \n" +
        "While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? \n" +
        "When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. \n" +
        "But Jesus answered, Let me at least do this—and he touched his ear, and healed him. Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?   When I was with you in the temple daily, you didnt stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.  \n" +
        "They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priests house. But Peter followed from a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, This man also was with him. \n" +
        "He denied Jesus, saying, Woman, I dont know him. \n" +
        "After a little while someone else saw him, and said, You also are one of them! \n" +
        "But Peter answered, Man, I am not! \n" +
        "After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean! \n" +
        "But Peter said, Man, I dont know what you are talking about! Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lords word, how he said to him, Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times. He went out, and wept bitterly. \n" +
        "The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you? They spoke many other things against him, insulting him. \n" +
        "As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, If you are the Christ, tell us. \n" +
        "But he said to them, If I tell you, you wont believe,   and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.   From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God. \n" +
        "They all said, Are you then the Son of God? \n" +
        "He said to them, You say it, because I am. \n" +
        "They said, Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth! \n" +
        "The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king. \n" +
        "Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "He answered him, So you say. \n" +
        "Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no basis for a charge against this man. \n" +
        "But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place. But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. When he found out that he was in Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. \n" +
        "Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. \n" +
        "Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them, You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. \n" +
        "Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast. But they all cried out together, saying, Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!— one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. \n" +
        "Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, but they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify him! \n" +
        "He said to them the third time, Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. \n" +
        "When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, dont weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.   For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.   Then they will begin to tell the mountains, Fall on us! and tell the hills, Cover us.  For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry? \n" +
        "There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. \n" +
        "Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they dont know what they are doing. \n" +
        "Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one! \n" +
        "The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself! \n" +
        "An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. \n" +
        "One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us! \n" +
        "But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dont you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong. He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise. \n" +
        "It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit! Having said this, he breathed his last. \n" +
        "When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts. All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. \n" +
        "Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God: this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus body. He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. \n" +
        "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. They entered in, and didnt find the Lord Jesus body. It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing. Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. \n" +
        "They said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead? He isnt here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again? \n" +
        "They remembered his words, returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles. These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didnt believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened. \n" +
        "Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened. It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. He said to them, What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad? \n" +
        "One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesnt know the things which have happened there in these days? \n" +
        "He said to them, What things? \n" +
        "They said to him, The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; and when they didnt find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didnt see him. \n" +
        "He said to them, Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!   Didnt the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory? Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further. \n" +
        "They urged him, saying, Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over. \n" +
        "He went in to stay with them. It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them. Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. They said one to another, Werent our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us? They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon! They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread. \n" +
        "As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, Peace be to you. \n" +
        "But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. \n" +
        "He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?   See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesnt have flesh and bones, as you see that I have. When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While they still didnt believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Do you have anything here to eat? \n" +
        "They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. He took them, and ate in front of them. He said to them, This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled. \n" +
        "Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,   and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.   You are witnesses of these things.   Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.  \n" +
        "He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. \n" +

        "John  \n" +
        " \n" +
        "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasnt overcome  it. There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world. \n" +
        "He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didnt recognize him. He came to his own, and those who were his own didnt receive him. But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become Gods children, to those who believe in his name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. John testified about him. He cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me. From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him. \n" +
        "This is Johns testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? \n" +
        "He declared, and didnt deny, but he declared, I am not the Christ. \n" +
        "They asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? \n" +
        "He said, I am not. \n" +
        "Are you the prophet? \n" +
        "He answered, No. \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself? \n" +
        "He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as Isaiah the prophet said. \n" +
        "The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. They asked him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? \n" +
        "John answered them, I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you dont know. He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap Im not worthy to loosen. These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. \n" +
        "The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me. I didnt know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel. John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. I didnt recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God. \n" +
        "Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God! The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What are you looking for? \n" +
        "They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where are you staying? \n" +
        "He said to them, Come, and see. \n" +
        "They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother. He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah! (which is, being interpreted, Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter). On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, Follow me. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. \n" +
        "Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? \n" +
        "Philip said to him, Come and see. \n" +
        "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit! \n" +
        "Nathanael said to him, How do you know me? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. \n" +
        "Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel! \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Because I told you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these! He said to him, Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. \n" +
        "The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus mother was there. Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage. When the wine ran out, Jesus mother said to him, They have no wine. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come. \n" +
        "His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it. Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece. Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. They filled them up to the brim. He said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast. So they took it. When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didnt know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom, and said to him, Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now! This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. \n" +
        "After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days. The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers money, and overthrew their tables. To those who sold the doves, he said, Take these things out of here! Dont make my Fathers house a marketplace! His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore answered him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore said, It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days? But he spoke of the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. \n" +
        "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did. But Jesus didnt trust himself to them, because he knew everyone, and because he didnt need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man. \n" +
        "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he cant see the Kingdom of God. \n" +
        "Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb, and be born? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he cant enter into the Kingdom of God!   That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   Dont marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew.   The windblows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but dont know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. \n" +
        "Nicodemus answered him, How can these things be? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and dont understand these things?   Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you dont receive our witness.   If I told you earthly things and you dont believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?   No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.   For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.   For God didnt send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.   He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesnt believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.   This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.   For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesnt come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.   But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God. \n" +
        "After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized. John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized. For John was not yet thrown into prison. There arose therefore a questioning on the part of Johns disciples with some Jews about purification. They came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him. \n" +
        "John answered, A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven. You yourselves testify that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent before him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease. He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness. He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys  the Son wont see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. \n" +
        "Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus himself didnt baptize, but his disciples), he left Judea, and departed into Galilee. He needed to pass through Samaria. So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. Jacobs well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me a drink. For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. \n" +
        "The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans). \n" +
        "Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. \n" +
        "The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water? Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock? \n" +
        "Jesus answered her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,   but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life. \n" +
        "The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I dont get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.  \n" +
        "The woman answered, I have no husband. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, You said well, I have no husband,   for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly. \n" +
        "The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.   You worship that which you dont know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.   But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.   God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. \n" +
        "The woman said to him, I know that Messiah comes, (he who is called Christ). When he has come, he will declare to us all things. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, I am he, the one who speaks to you. At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are you looking for? or, Why do you speak with her? So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people, Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ? \n" +
        "They went out of the city, and were coming to him. In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat. \n" +
        "But he said to them, I have food to eat that you dont know about. \n" +
        "The disciples therefore said one to another, Has anyone brought him something to eat? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.   Dont you say, There are yet four months until the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.   He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.   For in this the saying is true, One sows, and another reaps.   I sent you to reap that for which you havent labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor. \n" +
        "From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me everything that I did. So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. Many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. \n" +
        "After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe. \n" +
        "The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down before my child dies. Jesus said to him, Go your way. Your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying Your child lives! So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. He believed, as did his whole house. This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee. \n" +
        "After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had. A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, Do you want to be made well? \n" +
        "The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while Im coming, another steps down before me. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your mat, and walk. \n" +
        "Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. \n" +
        "Now it was the Sabbath on that day. So the Jews said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat. \n" +
        "He answered them, He who made me well, the same said to me, Take up your mat, and walk. \n" +
        "Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat, and walk? \n" +
        "But he who was healed didnt know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place. \n" +
        "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.  \n" +
        "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working, so I am working, too. For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. Jesus therefore answered them, Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.   For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.   For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.   For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,   that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesnt honor the Son doesnt honor the Father who sent him. \n" +
        " Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesnt come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.   Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of Gods voice; and those who hear will live.   For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.   He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.   Dont marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,   and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.   I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I dont seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me. \n" +
        " If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.   It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.   You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.   But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.   He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.   But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.   The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.   You dont have his word living in you; because you dont believe him whom he sent. \n" +
        " You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.   Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.   I dont receive glory from men.   But I know you, that you dont have Gods love in yourselves.   I have come in my Fathers name, and you dont receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.   How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you dont seek the glory that comes from the only God? \n" +
        " Dont think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.   For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.   But if you dont believe his writings, how will you believe my words? \n" +
        "After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias. A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick. Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat? This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. \n" +
        "Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little. \n" +
        "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, said to him, There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many? \n" +
        "Jesus said, Have the people sit down. Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired. When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost. So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten. When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, This is truly the prophet who comes into the world. Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself. \n" +
        "When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing. When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,  they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid. But he said to them, It is I. Dont be afraid. They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going. \n" +
        "On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadnt entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone. However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasnt there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, Rabbi, when did you come here? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.   Dont work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him. \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent. \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. \n" +
        "Jesus therefore said to them, Most certainly, I tell you, it wasnt Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.   For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world. \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, Lord, always give us this bread. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.   But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you dont believe.   All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.   For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.   This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.   This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. They said, Isnt this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, I have come down out of heaven?  \n" +
        "Therefore Jesus answered them, Dont murmur among yourselves.   No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.   It is written in the prophets, They will all be taught by God.   Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.   Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.   Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.   I am the bread of life.   Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.   This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.   I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? \n" +
        "Jesus therefore said to them, Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you dont have life in yourselves.   He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.   For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.   He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.   As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.   This is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever. He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. \n" +
        "Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it? \n" +
        "But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?   Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?   It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.   But there are some of you who dont believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didnt believe, and who it was who would betray him. He said, For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father. \n" +
        "At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Jesus said therefore to the twelve, You dont also want to go away, do you? \n" +
        "Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Didnt I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil? Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve. \n" +
        "After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldnt walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world. For even his brothers didnt believe in him. \n" +
        "Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.   The world cant hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.   You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled. \n" +
        "Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray. Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never been educated? \n" +
        "Jesus therefore answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.   If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.   He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.   Didnt Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me? \n" +
        "The multitude answered, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.   Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.   If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?   Dont judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.  \n" +
        "Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, Isnt this he whom they seek to kill? Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from. \n" +
        "Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you dont know.   I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me. \n" +
        "They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, When the Christ comes, he wont do more signs than those which this man has done, will he? The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.   You will seek me, and wont find me; and where I am, you cant come. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we wont find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? What is this word that he said, You will seek me, and wont find me; and where I am, you cant come? \n" +
        "Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!   He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water. But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasnt yet glorified. \n" +
        "Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? Hasnt the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David,  and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why didnt you bring him? \n" +
        "The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this man! \n" +
        "The Pharisees therefore answered them, You arent also led astray, are you? Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees? But this multitude that doesnt know the law is accursed. \n" +
        "Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them, Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does? \n" +
        "They answered him, Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee. \n" +
        "Everyone went to his own house, \n" +
        "but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst, they told him, Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her? They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. \n" +
        "But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.  Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. \n" +
        "They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you? \n" +
        "She said, No one, Lord. \n" +
        "Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more. \n" +
        "Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world.He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life. \n" +
        "The Pharisees therefore said to him, You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you dont know where I came from, or where I am going.   You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.   Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.   Its also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.  I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me. \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, Where is your Father? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also. Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. Jesus said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you cant come.  \n" +
        "The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I am going, you cant come? \n" +
        "He said to them, You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.   I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I amhe, you will die in your sins.  \n" +
        "They said therefore to him, Who are you? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.   I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world. \n" +
        "They didnt understand that he spoke to them about the Father. Jesus therefore said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.   He who sent me is with me. The Father hasnt left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him. \n" +
        "As he spoke these things, many believed in him. Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.   You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.  \n" +
        "They answered him, We are Abrahams seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, You will be made free? \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.   A bondservant doesnt live in the house forever. A son remains forever.   If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.   I know that you are Abrahams seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.   I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father. \n" +
        "They answered him, Our father is Abraham. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, If you were Abrahams children, you would do the works of Abraham.   But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didnt do this.   You do the works of your father. \n" +
        "They said to him, We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God. \n" +
        "Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I havent come of myself, but he sent me.   Why dont you understand my speech? Because you cant hear my word.   You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesnt stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father.   But because I tell the truth, you dont believe me.   Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?   He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you dont hear, because you are not of God. \n" +
        "Then the Jews answered him, Dont we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, I dont have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.   But I dont seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.   Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death. \n" +
        "Then the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death. Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.   You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, I dont know him, I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.   Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM. \n" +
        "Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through their midst, and so passed by. \n" +
        "As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.   I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.   While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind mans eyes with the mud, and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which means Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, Isnt this he who sat and begged? Others were saying, It is he. Still others were saying, He looks like him. \n" +
        "He said, I am he. They therefore were asking him, How were your eyes opened? \n" +
        "He answered, A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash. So I went away and washed, and I received sight. \n" +
        "Then they asked him, Where is he? \n" +
        "He said, I dont know. \n" +
        "They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see. \n" +
        "Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesnt keep the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? There was division among them. Therefore they asked the blind man again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes? \n" +
        "He said, He is a prophet. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, and asked them, Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see? \n" +
        "His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees, we dont know; or who opened his eyes, we dont know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself. His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, He is of age. Ask him. \n" +
        "So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner. \n" +
        "He therefore answered, I dont know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see. \n" +
        "They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes? \n" +
        "He answered them, I told you already, and you didnt listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You dont also want to become his disciples, do you? \n" +
        "They insulted him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we dont know where he comes from. \n" +
        "The man answered them, How amazing! You dont know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God doesnt listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him. Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. \n" +
        "They answered him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? They threw him out. \n" +
        "Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of God? \n" +
        "He answered, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you. \n" +
        "He said, Lord, I believe! and he worshiped him. \n" +
        "Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that those who dont see may see; and that those who see may become blind. \n" +
        "Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind? \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, We see. Therefore your sin remains. \n" +
        " Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesnt enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.   But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.   The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.   Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.   They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they dont know the voice of strangers. Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didnt understand what he was telling them. \n" +
        "Jesus therefore said to them again, Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheeps door.   All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didnt listen to them.   I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.   The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.   I am the good shepherd.The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.   He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesnt own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.   The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesnt care for the sheep.   I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and Im known by my own;   even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.   I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.   Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.   No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father. \n" +
        "Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him? Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isnt possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it? \n" +
        "It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomons porch. The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, I told you, and you dont believe. The works that I do in my Fathers name, these testify about me.   But you dont believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.   I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.   My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Fathers hand.   I and the Father are one. \n" +
        "Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me? \n" +
        "The Jews answered him, We dont stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Isnt it written in your law, I said, you are gods?  If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cant be broken),   do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?   If I dont do the works of my Father, dont believe me.   But if I do them, though you dont believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.  \n" +
        "They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand. He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed. Many came to him. They said, John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true. Many believed in him there. \n" +
        "Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick. The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick. But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that Gods Son may be glorified by it. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, Lets go into Judea again. \n" +
        "The disciples told him, Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Arent there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesnt stumble, because he sees the light of this world.   But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isnt in him. He said these things, and after that, he said to them, Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep. \n" +
        "The disciples therefore said, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. \n" +
        "Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep. So Jesus said to them plainly then, Lazarus is dead.   I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, lets go to him. \n" +
        "Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Lets go also, that we may die with him. \n" +
        "So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away. Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. Therefore Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnt have died. Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. \n" +
        "Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.   Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this? \n" +
        "She said to him, Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, Gods Son, he who comes into the world. \n" +
        "When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and is calling you. \n" +
        "When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there. Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnt have died. \n" +
        "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, and said, Where have you laid him? \n" +
        "They told him, Lord, come and see. \n" +
        "Jesus wept. \n" +
        "The Jews therefore said, See how much affection he had for him! Some of them said, Couldnt this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying? \n" +
        "Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, Take away the stone. \n" +
        "Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Didnt I tell you that if you believed, you would see Gods glory? \n" +
        "So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you listened to me.   I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.  When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out! \n" +
        "He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Free him, and let him go. \n" +
        "Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? For this man does many signs. If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. \n" +
        "But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish. Now he didnt say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death. Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples. \n" +
        "Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves. Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think—that he isnt coming to the feast at all? Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him. \n" +
        "Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him. Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. Then Judas Iscariot, Simons son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, Why wasnt this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor? Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it. But Jesus said, Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.   For you always have the poor with you, but you dont always have me. \n" +
        "A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus. \n" +
        "On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel! \n" +
        "Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, Dont be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkeys colt. His disciples didnt understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him. The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it. For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him. \n" +
        "Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast. These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus. Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. Jesus answered them, The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.   Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.   He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.   If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. \n" +
        " Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? Father, save me from this time? But for this cause I came to this time.   Father, glorify your name! \n" +
        "Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. \n" +
        "The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him. \n" +
        "Jesus answered, This voice hasnt come for my sake, but for your sakes.   Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.   And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself. But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die. The multitude answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? \n" +
        "Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesnt overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesnt know where he is going.   While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light. Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them. But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didnt believe in him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, \n" +
        "Lord, who has believed our report? \n" +
        "To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? \n" +
        "For this cause they couldnt believe, for Isaiah said again, \n" +
        "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, \n" +
        "lest they should see with their eyes, \n" +
        "and perceive with their heart, \n" +
        "and would turn, \n" +
        "and I would heal them. \n" +
        "Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.  Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didnt confess it, so that they wouldnt be put out of the synagogue, for they loved mens praise more than Gods praise. \n" +
        "Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.   He who sees me sees him who sent me.   I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.   If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesnt believe, I dont judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.   He who rejects me, and doesnt receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.   For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.   I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak. \n" +
        "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simons son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God, arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist. Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, You dont know what I am doing now, but you will understand later. \n" +
        "Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet! \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, If I dont wash you, you have no part with me.  \n" +
        "Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head! \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.  For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, You are not all clean. So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?   You call me, Teacher and Lord. You say so correctly, for so I am.   If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anothers feet.   For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.   Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.   If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.   I dont speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.  From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.   Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me. \n" +
        "When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me. \n" +
        "The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke. One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus breast. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaks. \n" +
        "He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus breast, asked him, Lord, who is it? \n" +
        "Jesus therefore answered, It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it. So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. \n" +
        "Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly. \n" +
        "Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him. For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor. Therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night. \n" +
        "When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.   If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.   Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you cant come, so now I tell you.   A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.   By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. \n" +
        "Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, Where I am going, you cant follow now, but you will follow afterwards. \n" +
        "Peter said to him, Lord, why cant I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you. \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster wont crow until you have denied me three times. \n" +
        " Dont let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.   In my Fathers house are many homes. If it werent so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.   If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.   Where I go, you know, and you know the way. \n" +
        "Thomas said to him, Lord, we dont know where you are going. How can we know the way? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.   If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him. \n" +
        "Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, Show us the Father?   Dont you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.   Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works sake.   Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.   Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.   If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.   If you love me, keep my commandments.   I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,—  the Spirit of truth, whom the world cant receive; for it doesnt see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.   I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.   Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.   In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.   One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him. \n" +
        "Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.   He who doesnt love me doesnt keep my words. The word which you hear isnt mine, but the Fathers who sent me.   I have said these things to you, while still living with you.   But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.   Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Dont let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.   You heard how I told you, I go away, and I come to you. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said I am going to my Father; for the Father is greater than I.   Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.   I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.   But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here. \n" +
        " I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.   Every branch in me that doesnt bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.   You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.   Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cant bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.   I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.   If a man doesnt remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.   If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. \n" +
        " In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.   Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.   If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Fathers commandments, and remain in his love.   I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. \n" +
        " This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.   Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.   You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.   No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesnt know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.   You didnt choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. \n" +
        " I command these things to you, that you may love one another.   If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.   If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.   Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his lord.If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.   But all these things will they do to you for my names sake, because they dont know him who sent me.   If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.   He who hates me, hates my Father also.   If I hadnt done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldnt have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.   But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, They hated me without a cause. \n" +
        " When the Counselorhas come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.   You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning. \n" +
        " These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldnt be caused to stumble.   They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.   They will do these thingsbecause they have not known the Father, nor me.   But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didnt tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.   But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, Where are you going?   But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.   Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I dont go away, the Counselor wont come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.   When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;   about sin, because they dont believe in me;   about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you wont see me any more;   about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.  \n" +
        " I have yet many things to tell you, but you cant bear them now.   However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.   He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.   All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takesof mine, and will declare it to you.   A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me. \n" +
        "Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you wont see me, and again a little while, and you will see me; and, Because I go to the Father?  They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while?  We dont know what he is saying. \n" +
        "Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and you wont see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?   Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.   A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesnt remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.   Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. \n" +
        " In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.   Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.   I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.   In that day you will ask in my name; and I dont say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,   for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.   I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. \n" +
        "His disciples said to him, Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech. Now we know that you know all things, and dont need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God. \n" +
        "Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?   Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.   I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.  \n" +
        "Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;   even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.   This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.   I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.   Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.   I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.   Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,   for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.   I pray for them. I dont pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.   All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.   I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.   While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.   But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.   I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.   I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.   They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.   Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.  As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.   For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.   Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,   that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.   The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;   I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.   Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.   Righteous Father, the world hasnt known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.   I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them. \n" +
        "When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, Who are you looking for? \n" +
        "They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, I am he. \n" +
        "Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. \n" +
        "Again therefore he asked them, Who are you looking for? \n" +
        "They said, Jesus of Nazareth. \n" +
        "Jesus answered, I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way, that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none. \n" +
        "Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus. Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it? \n" +
        "So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people. Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you also one of this mans disciples? \n" +
        "He said, I am not. \n" +
        "Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.   Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said. \n" +
        "When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest like that? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me? \n" +
        "Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, You arent also one of his disciples, are you? \n" +
        "He denied it, and said, I am not. \n" +
        "One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Didnt I see you in the garden with him? \n" +
        "Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed. \n" +
        "They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didnt enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man? \n" +
        "They answered him, If this man werent an evildoer, we wouldnt have delivered him up to you. \n" +
        "Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. \n" +
        "Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death, that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die. \n" +
        "Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "Jesus answered him, Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me? \n" +
        "Pilate answered, Im not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldnt be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here. \n" +
        "Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice. \n" +
        "Pilate said to him, What is truth? \n" +
        "When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no basis for a charge against him. But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews? \n" +
        "Then they all shouted again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber. \n" +
        "So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him. The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment. They kept saying, Hail, King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him. \n" +
        "Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him. \n" +
        "Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, Behold, the man! \n" +
        "When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify! \n" +
        "Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him. \n" +
        "The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. \n" +
        "When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid. He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, Arent you speaking to me? Dont you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you? \n" +
        "Jesus answered, You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin. \n" +
        "At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you arent Caesars friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar! \n" +
        "When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, Behold, your King! \n" +
        "They cried out, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! \n" +
        "Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? \n" +
        "The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar! \n" +
        "So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle. Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Dont write, The King of the Jews, but, he said, I am King of the Jews. \n" +
        "Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. \n" +
        "Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. Then they said to one another, Lets not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, \n" +
        "They parted my garments among them. \n" +
        "For my cloak they cast lots. \n" +
        "Therefore the soldiers did these things. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!  Then he said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. \n" +
        "After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I am thirsty. Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished. He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit. \n" +
        "Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldnt remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didnt break his legs. However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe. For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be broken. Again another Scripture says, They will look on him whom they pierced. \n" +
        "After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body. Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds. So they took Jesus body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid. Then because of the Jews Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there. \n" +
        "Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we dont know where they have laid him! \n" +
        "Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didnt enter in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed. For as yet they didnt know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. So the disciples went away again to their own homes. \n" +
        "But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. They told her, Woman, why are you weeping? \n" +
        "She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I dont know where they have laid him. When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didnt know that it was Jesus. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for? \n" +
        "She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away. \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Mary. \n" +
        "She turned and said to him, Rabboni! which is to say, Teacher! \n" +
        "Jesus said to her, Dont hold me, for I havent yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. \n" +
        "Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her. When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you. \n" +
        "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you. When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit!   If you forgive anyones sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyones sins, they have been retained. \n" +
        "But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasnt with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord! \n" +
        "But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. \n" +
        "After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you. Then he said to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Dont be unbelieving, but believing. \n" +
        "Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God! \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me,you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed. \n" +
        "Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name. \n" +
        "After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way. Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, Im going fishing. \n" +
        "They told him, We are also coming with you. They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didnt know that it was Jesus. Jesus therefore said to them, Children, have you anything to eat?  \n" +
        "They answered him, No. \n" +
        "He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. \n" +
        "They cast it therefore, and now they werent able to draw it in for the multitude of fish. That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, Its the Lord! \n" +
        "So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish. So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught. \n" +
        "Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasnt torn. \n" +
        "Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast. \n" +
        "None of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord. \n" +
        "Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these? \n" +
        "He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you. \n" +
        "He said to him, Feed my lambs. He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? \n" +
        "He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you. \n" +
        "He said to him, Tend my sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me? \n" +
        "Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, Do you have affection for me? He said to him, Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you. \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.   Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you dont want to go. \n" +
        "Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, Follow me. \n" +
        "Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus breast at the supper and asked, Lord, who is going to betray You? Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man? \n" +
        "Jesus said to him, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me. This saying therefore went out among the brothere, that this disciple wouldnt die. Yet Jesus didnt say to him that he wouldnt die, but, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true. There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldnt have room for the books that would be written. \n" +
